1
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,517
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,214
It was our aunt's.

3
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,616
We used to come here as kids.

4
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,828
The Order uses it
now as a safe house.

5
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,229
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:53,596
Muggles think these keep evil away,
but they're wrong.

7
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,040
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,184
How are you?

9
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,692
Alive.

10
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,239
You probably don't remember...

11
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,730
That I showed you to your vault the
first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,199
Even amongst goblins you're famous,
Harry Potter.

13
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:33,639
You buried the elf.

14
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,206
Yes.

15
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,076
And brought me here.

16
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,781
You are...

17
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,020
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,796
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,704
It's complicated.

20
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,505
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,679
It's complicated.

22
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:16,580
The sword presented itself
to us in a moment of need.

23
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,481
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,930
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,724
...but it is a fake.

26
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,560
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:32,237
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,106
Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,970
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:42,604
A Hogwarts professor. As I understand it,
he's now headmaster.

31
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,466
Snape?

32
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,152
He put a fake sword
in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,905
Why?

34
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,652
There are more than a few curious
things in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,555
And in Madam Lestrange's
vault as well?

36
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,460
Perhaps.

37
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,273
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,101
This is impossible.

39
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,178
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,775
Why should I help you?

41
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,683
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,882
-I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,598
That.

44
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,959
That is my price.

45
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,183
Are you thinking there's a
Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,853
She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.

47
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,834
She kept asking you what else we'd taken.

48
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:59,991
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,094
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,892
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,667
How are we supposed to destroy it now
you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,693
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,301
He's weak.

54
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,345
Yes?

55
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,183
Mr. Ollivander, I need to
ask you a few questions.

56
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,121
Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,654
Would you mind
identifying this wand?

58
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,458
We need to know if
it's safe to use.

59
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,168
Walnut.

60
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,635
Dragon heartstring.

61
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,076
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,846
Unyie...

63
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,613
Unyielding.

64
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,954
This belonged to
Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,924
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,925
And this?

67
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,201
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,132
And unicorn hair.

69
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,971
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:34,043
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,278
Was? Is it not still?

72
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,586
Well, perhaps not,
if you won it from him.

73
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,592
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:57,174
You talk about wands as
if they have feelings...

75
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,373
...can think.

76
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:08,220
The wand chooses the wizard,
Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,725
That much has always been clear to
those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,295
And what do you know about
the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,300
The Elder Wand...

80
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:36,310
...the Cloak of Invisibility to
hide you from your enemies...

81
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:42,318
...and the Resurrection Stone to
bring back loved ones from the dead.

82
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:47,448
Together, they make one the master of death.

83
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:53,724
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

84
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,560
Do you?

85
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,295
Do you believe they exist, sir?

86
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:08,443
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

87
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,108
You're lying.

88
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,578
You know one exists.

89
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,584
You told him about it.

90
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:21,284
You told him about the Elder Wand and
where he could go looking for it.

91
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,891
He tortured me.

92
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,402
Besides...

93
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,101
...I only conveyed rumors.

94
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,400
There's...

95
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,775
There's no telling
whether he will find it.

96
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,683
He has found it, sir.

97
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,355
We'll let you rest.

98
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,296
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

99
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,739
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

100
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,236
...I'm afraid...

101
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,745
...you really don't stand a chance.

102
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,508
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill
him before he finds me, then.

103
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,951
Are you sure that's hers?

104
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,251
Positive.

105
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,893
Well?

106
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,834
How do I look?

107
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,901
Hideous.

108
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,839
You can give that to Hermione to hold,
all right, Griphook?

109
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,858
We're relying on you.

110
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:11,059
If you get us past the guards and
into the vault, the sword's yours.

111
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,810
Madam Lestrange.

112
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,747
Good morning.

113
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:31,614
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

114
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,920
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

115
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,789
Hey. Easy.

116
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:41,524
She gives us away, we might as well use
that sword to slit our own throats.

117
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,565
Understand?

118
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,228
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

119
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,996
Okay.

120
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,902
Let's do it.

121
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,443
I wish to enter my vault.

122
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,911
Identification?

123
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,544
I hardly think
that'll be necessary.

124
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,922
Madam Lestrange.

125
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,326
I don't like to be kept waiting.

126
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,500
They know.

127
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,830
They know she's an imposter.

128
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,471
They've been warned.

129
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,075
Harry?

130
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,811
What do we do, Harry?

131
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:52,229
Madam Lestrange, would you
mind presenting your wand?

132
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,394
And why should I do that?

133
00:13:54,566 --> 00:14:00,129
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

134
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,433
No. I most certainly
do not understand.

135
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,443
I'm afraid I must insist.

136
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,652
HARRY Imperio.

137
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,323
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

138
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,699
What is that, Griphook?

139
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,437
Griphook.

140
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,917
Arresto momentum.

141
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,930
Well done, Hermione.

142
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,107
Oh, no, you look like you again.

143
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,578
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

144
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,840
Can be deadly.

145
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,643
You don't say.

146
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,810
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

147
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,649
No.

148
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,526
What the devil are all you doing down here?

149
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,922
Thieves!

150
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,360
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Imperio.

151
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,637
That doesn't sound good.

152
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,387
Bloody hell.

153
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,057
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

154
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,582
Here.

155
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,571
It's been trained to expect
pain when it hears the noise.

156
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,264
That's barbaric.

157
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,906
Lumos.

158
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,568
Blimey.

159
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,847
Accio Horcrux.

160
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,490
You're not trying that one again, are you?

161
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,357
That kind of magic
won't work in here.

162
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,557
Is it in here, Harry?

163
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,835
Can you feel anything?

164
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,152
That's it. Up there.

165
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,095
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

166
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,602
Give me the sword.

167
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,282
Stop moving.

168
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,145
Got it.

169
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,374
We had a deal, Griphook.

170
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,916
The cup for the sword.

171
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:24,618
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say
anything about getting you out.

172
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,310
Griphook!

173
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,147
- Thieves! Help!
-Griphook!

174
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,152
Thieves!

175
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,760
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

176
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,660
That's unfortunate.

177
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,836
We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?

178
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,534
You're the brilliant one.

179
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,976
I've got something, but it's mad.

180
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,479
Reducto.

181
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,521
Well, come on, then.

182
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,225
Relashio.

183
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,815
Keep moving! Aah!

184
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,569
Now what?

185
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,075
Reducto.

186
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,712
Hold on.

187
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,160
That was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

188
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,251
We're dropping.

189
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,491
- I say we jump.
-When?

190
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,028
Now.

191
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,421
He knows. You-Know-Who.

192
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,208
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

193
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,554
He knows what we took and he
knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

194
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,524
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

195
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,163
You let him in? Harry,
you can't do that.

196
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,892
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

197
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,763
Never mind. What happened?

198
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,734
Well, he's angry.

199
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,463
And scared too.

200
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:06,310
He knows if we find and destroy all the
Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

201
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,974
I reckon he'll stop at nothing to
make sure we don't find the rest.

202
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,446
There's more.
One of them's at Hogwarts.

203
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,313
What?

204
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,149
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

205
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,883
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

206
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,358
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

207
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,657
Hermione, when have any of our
plans ever actually worked?

208
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,232
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

209
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,631
He's right.

210
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,036
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.

211
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:41,975
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

212
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,479
Take the secret
passage in the cellar.

213
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,016
It's... There's something
wrong with him.

214
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:52,520
It's like, you know, in the past, I've
always been able to follow his thoughts.

215
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,558
And now everything just feels disconnected.

216
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,024
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

217
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,355
Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.

218
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,492
No. No, it's more
like he's wounded.

219
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,465
If anything,
he feels more dangerous.

220
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,002
VOLDEMORT

221
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:56,987
MAN 1: They're here! MAN 2:
Search everywhere!

222
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,698
MAN 1: Look down by the stables!
You two, come with me!

223
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,848
Any sign?

224
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,425
Potter!

225
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,123
In here, Potter.

226
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,606
Did you get a look at him?

227
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,571
-For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

228
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,524
Harry?

229
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,724
I can see you in this.

230
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,471
You bloody fools. What were
you thinking coming here?

231
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,911
Have you any idea
how dangerous it is?

232
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,746
You're Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.

233
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,191
It's you who I've
been seeing in here.

234
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,549
You're the one who sent Dobby.

235
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,022
Where have you left him?

236
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,757
He's dead.

237
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,353
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

238
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,466
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

239
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,267
Mundungus Fletcher,
about a year ago.

240
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,702
-Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.

241
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,072
Albus told me.

242
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,874
He also told me you'd likely be hacked
off if you ever found out I had it...

243
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:07,950
...but ask yourself,
where would you be if I didn't?

244
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,618
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

245
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,759
The Order's finished.

246
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,292
You-Know-Who's won.

247
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,863
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

248
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,557
We need to get into
Hogwarts, tonight.

249
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,697
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

250
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,531
Did he now?

251
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,139
Nice job? Easy?

252
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,243
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

253
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:37,014
We think the last one's inside the castle,
but we'll need help getting in.

254
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,712
That's not a job my brother's given you.
It's a suicide mission.

255
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,252
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

256
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,086
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

257
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:52,229
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

258
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,996
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

259
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,095
Did he ever mention hers?

260
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,967
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

261
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,467
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

262
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,739
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

263
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,745
...who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

264
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,119
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

265
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,314
That's what a fool does.

266
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,393
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter.

267
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:29,226
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

268
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,579
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

269
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,537
I don't care that you've given up.

270
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,606
I trusted the man I knew.

271
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,811
And we need to get into the castle tonight.

272
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,492
You know what to do.

273
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,035
Where have you sent her?

274
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,064
You'll see soon enough.

275
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,043
That's your sister,
Ariana, isn't it?

276
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,750
She died very young, didn't she?

277
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:26,418
My brother sacrificed
many things, Mr. Potter...

278
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,082
...on his journey to find power...

279
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,524
...including Ariana.

280
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:34,830
And she was devoted to him.

281
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,867
He gave her everything...

282
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,565
...but time.

283
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,339
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

284
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,707
He did save our lives twice.

285
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,513
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

286
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,815
That doesn't seem like
someone who's given up.

287
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,090
She's coming back.

288
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,959
Who's that with her?

289
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,300
Neville.

290
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,002
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

291
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,774
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

292
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,978
Hey, Ab, we've got a
couple more coming through.

293
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:32,222
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.

294
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,291
That's because it never
existed till now.

295
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,727
The seven secret passages were sealed
off before the start of the year.

296
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,491
This is the only way in or out now.

297
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:42,466
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

298
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,196
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

299
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:47,438
Hardly ever see him. It's the
Carrows you need to watch out for.

300
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,522
Carrows?

301
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,143
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

302
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,049
They like punishment, the Carrows.

303
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,202
They did that to you? Why?

304
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:59,042
Today's Dark Arts lessons had us
practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

305
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,117
On first-years.

306
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,116
I refused.

307
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,048
Hogwarts has changed.

308
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,404
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

309
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,446
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

310
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,710
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

311
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,646
Blimey.

312
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,154
- Harry!
- Yeah!

313
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,727
Get the word out to Remus and
the others that Harry's back.

314
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,175
Okay, let's not kill him
before You-Know-Who...

315
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,700
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

316
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,903
Lightning has struck.

317
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,741
What's the plan, Harry?

318
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,670
Okay.

319
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,715
There's something we need to find.

320
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:18,851
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

321
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,827
Right. What is it?

322
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,158
We don't know.

323
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,036
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

324
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,637
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

325
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,277
I think it has something
to do with Ravenclaw.

326
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:39,109
Um, it'll be small,
easily concealed.

327
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,111
Anyone, any ideas?

328
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,945
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

329
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,523
Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.

330
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,752
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

331
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,195
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

332
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,733
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

333
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,701
There isn't a person alive
today who's seen it.

334
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:04,241
Excuse me. Can someone tell
me what a bloody diadem is?

335
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,972
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

336
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,510
Harry.

337
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,080
Hi there.

338
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:20,490
Six months she hasn't seen me and
it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

339
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,301
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

340
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,724
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

341
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,385
What is it, Ginny?

342
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,762
Snape knows. He knows that
Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

343
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:15,377
Many of you are surely wondering why
I have summoned you at this hour.

344
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:21,614
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

345
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,318
...Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

346
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,417
Now...

347
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,185
...should anyone...

348
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:38,096
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

349
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,363
...they will be punished...

350
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,999
...in a matter consistent with the
severity of their transgression.

351
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,407
Furthermore...

352
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:53,443
...any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

353
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,721
...who fails to come forward...

354
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:04,219
...will be treated as...

355
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:08,092
...equally guilty.

356
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,232
Now then...

357
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,799
...if anyone here...

358
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:24,441
...has any knowledge of Mr.
Potter's movements this evening...

359
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,552
...I invite them to step forward...

360
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,786
...now.

361
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,343
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

362
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,282
...you still have a bit of a
security problem, headmaster.

363
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,676
And I'm afraid it's
quite extensive.

364
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,515
How dare you stand where he stood?

365
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,252
Tell them how it
happened that night.

366
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,956
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

367
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,993
Tell them.

368
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:42,909
Coward!

369
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,437
Harry.

370
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,733
Potter?

371
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:36,938
I know that many of you
will want to fight.

372
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:42,142
Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.

373
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,613
But this is folly.

374
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,923
Give me Harry Potter.

375
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:54,058
Do this and none shall be harmed.

376
00:38:54,231 --> 00:39:00,261
Give me Harry Potter and I
shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

377
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:03,372
Give me Harry Potter...

378
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,477
...and you will be rewarded.

379
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,240
You have one hour.

380
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,959
What are you waiting for?

381
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,458
Someone grab him.

382
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,304
Students out of bed.

383
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,370
Students out of bed!

384
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,100
Students in the corridor!

385
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,678
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

386
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,516
Oh.

387
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,134
Sorry, ma'am.

388
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,187
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

389
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,654
If you would,
I would like you, please...

390
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:59,319
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the
rest of Slytherin House from the hall.

391
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,065
Exactly where is it I'll
be leading them to, ma'am?

392
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,830
The dungeons would do.

393
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,633
Right. Come on. Come on.

394
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:13,276
I presume you have a reason for returning,
Potter. What is it you need?

395
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,837
Time, professor. As much as you can get me.

396
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:20,008
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

397
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,476
Potter.

398
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,185
It's good to see you.

399
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,456
It's good to see you too,
professor.

400
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,290
Hold the fort, Neville.

401
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,590
Hurry up, come on!

402
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,334
Harry. Hermione and l have been thinking.

403
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,444
It doesn't matter if
we find a Horcrux.

404
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,842
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

405
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:52,279
So we were thinking...

406
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,979
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

407
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,309
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

408
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,652
Me and Hermione know
where we might find one.

409
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,589
Okay.

410
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,491
Okay, but take this. That way you
can find me when you get back.

411
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:08,898
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

412
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,423
Gotta start somewhere.

413
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,236
Harry.

414
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,933
Harry!

415
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,600
Let me get this straight.

416
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,738
- You're giving us permission to do this?
- That is correct, Longbottom.

417
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,349
To blow it up? Boom?

418
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,008
Boom!

419
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,587
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

420
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,088
Why don't you confer
with Mr. Finnigan?

421
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,820
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyrotechnics.

422
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,046
I can bring it down.

423
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,563
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

424
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:46,969
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

425
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,133
Well, that doesn't mean we can't delay him.

426
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:55,302
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

427
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,380
He's going to try to
kill you either way.

428
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,950
Piertotum Locomotor.

429
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,300
Hogwarts is threatened.

430
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:27,672
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

431
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,412
I've always wanted
to use that spell.

432
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,229
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

433
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:51,026
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

434
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:55,968
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

435
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,801
Protego Maxima.

436
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,406
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

437
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,376
You won't find anything where
you're going. You're wasting time.

438
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,545
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

439
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,945
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

440
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,048
You listen to me right now!

441
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,981
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

442
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,022
"There's not a person alive who's seen it."

443
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:51,890
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

444
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,070
It's very impressive, isn't it?

445
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,052
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

446
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,660
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

447
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,319
I think it's best if
you two talk alone.

448
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,692
She's very shy.

449
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,750
You're the Grey Lady...

450
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,291
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

451
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,193
I do not answer to that name.

452
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,928
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

453
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,231
Rowena's daughter.

454
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,431
Are you a friend of Luna's?

455
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,542
Yes.

456
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,178
And she thought you might
be able to help me.

457
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,675
You seek my mother's diadem.

458
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,880
Yes.

459
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,846
That's right.

460
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:32,255
Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others.

461
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,489
But she was wrong.
I cannot help you.

462
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,571
Wait. Please.

463
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,299
I want to destroy it.

464
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,805
They never learn.

465
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,977
Such a pity.

466
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:33,586
But, my Lord...

467
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,021
...shouldn't we wait for...?

468
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,922
My Lord.

469
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,567
Begin.

470
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,520
That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena?

471
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,358
You want it destroyed.

472
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,557
Another swore to destroy
it many years ago...

473
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,601
...a strange boy
with a strange name.

474
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,604
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

475
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,974
He's lied to many people.

476
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,236
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

477
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,313
He defiled it with dark magic!

478
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,993
I can destroy it once and for all.

479
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,937
But only if you tell
me where he hid it.

480
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:02,675
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

481
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,682
You just have to tell me.

482
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,948
Please.

483
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,996
Strange.

484
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,964
You remind me of him a bit.

485
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,436
It's here...

486
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,376
...in the castle, in the place
where everything is hidden.

487
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,982
If you have to ask...

488
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,449
...you will never know.

489
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,390
If you know, you need only ask.

490
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,254
Thank you.

491
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:08,307
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and l
will handle this side of the castle.

492
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,875
Yes, sir.

493
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,412
Hey, Dean, on second thoughts,
tell Professor McGonagall...

494
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,385
...we might need one or
two more wands this side.

495
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:26,061
It is the quality of one's convictions
that determines success...

496
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:27,825
...not the number of followers.

497
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,989
Who said that?

498
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:31,991
Me.

499
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,674
You okay, Freddie?

500
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,475
Yeah.

501
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,640
Me too.

502
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,359
Harry talks in his sleep. Have you noticed?

503
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,260
No, of course not.

504
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,478
Yeah?

505
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,143
You and whose army?

506
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,002
- You do it.
- I can't.

507
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:22,269
Yes, you can.

508
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:21,983
Neville!

509
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,075
That went well.

510
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:31,284
Get inside! This way, everyone. Take cover!

511
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,775
Stupefy!

512
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,639
Get your coat on!

513
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:56,910
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

514
00:55:57,086 --> 00:56:01,614
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire.
You haven't seen Luna, have you?

515
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,622
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

516
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:08,093
I think it's about time I told her since
we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

517
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,831
I know.

518
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,225
Bloody hell. We'll
never find it on this.

519
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,062
-There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

520
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:50,501
He just vanished.
Just now. I saw it.

521
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,776
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.

522
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,270
It doesn't show up on the map,
does it? You said that last year.

523
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,781
That's right. I... I did.

524
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,646
Let's go.

525
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,083
Brilliant.

526
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,355
Come on!

527
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,605
Well, well.

528
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,636
What brings you here, Potter?

529
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,345
I could ask you the same.

530
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,008
You have something of mine.

531
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,409
I'd like it back.

532
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,122
-What's wrong with the one you have?
- It's my mother's.

533
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,991
It's powerful,
but it's not the same.

534
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,789
Doesn't quite understand me.

535
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,764
Know what I mean?

536
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,300
Why didn't you tell her?

537
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,164
Bellatrix.

538
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,508
You knew it was me.

539
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,768
You didn't say anything.

540
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,810
Come on, Draco.

541
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,144
Don't be a prat. Do him.

542
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,282
Easy.

543
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:52,984
Expelliarmus.

544
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,206
Avada Kedavra!

545
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,407
Stupefy!

546
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,888
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

547
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,114
Got it.

548
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,260
Run!

549
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,692
Run!

550
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,603
Goyle's setting the
bloody place on fire!

551
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,506
Come on! This way!

552
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:01,806
We can't leave them.

553
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,145
He's joking, right?

554
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:15,661
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

555
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,015
Harry!

556
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,766
My Lord?

557
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,462
Avada Kedavra!

558
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:41,078
Come, Nagini.
I need to keep you safe.

559
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,293
It's the snake.

560
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,059
She's the last one.
It's the last Horcrux.

561
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,141
Look inside him, Harry.

562
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,076
Find out where he is.
If we find him, we can find the snake.

563
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,375
Then we can end this.

564
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,807
My Lord?

565
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:47,847
Might it be less, uh...

566
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:52,917
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

567
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,988
...and simply seek
the boy yourself?

568
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,491
I do not need to seek the boy.

569
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:04,065
Before the night is out,
he will come to me. Do you understand?

570
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,992
Look at me.

571
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,129
How can you live with
yourself, Lucius?

572
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,071
I don't know.

573
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,703
Go and find Severus.

574
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,374
Bring him to me.

575
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:31,416
I know where he is.

576
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,196
Come on!

577
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,372
Crucio!

578
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,553
No!

579
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,951
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

580
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,129
...in the last few hours alone.

581
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,069
No.

582
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,807
No, I am extraordinary...

583
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,608
...but the wand resists me.

584
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:36,842
There is no wand more powerful.

585
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,817
Ollivander himself has said it.

586
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:45,621
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

587
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,496
It answers to you...

588
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,699
...and you only.

589
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,926
Does it?

590
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:00,453
My Lord?

591
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:07,100
The wand, does it
truly answer to me?

592
01:08:08,872 --> 01:08:10,965
You're a clever man, Severus.

593
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:13,041
Surely you must know.

594
01:08:14,745 --> 01:08:18,442
Where does its true loyalty lie?

595
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,712
With you...

596
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:23,311
...of course, my Lord.

597
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:24,681
The Elder Wand...

598
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:31,291
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

599
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:37,891
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

600
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:47,470
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

601
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:53,612
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

602
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:58,816
You've been a good and
faithful servant, Severus...

603
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:04,386
...but only I can live forever.

604
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:08,748
My Lord...

605
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,831
Nagini, kill.

606
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,602
Take them.

607
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:22,705
Take them.

608
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,007
Please.

609
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,872
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

610
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:48,664
Take them to the Pensieve.

611
01:10:52,236 --> 01:10:54,204
Look at me.

612
01:10:59,943 --> 01:11:02,673
You have your mother's eyes.

613
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:39,907
You have fought valiantly...

614
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:44,048
...but in vain.

615
01:11:47,357 --> 01:11:49,621
I do not wish this.

616
01:11:49,793 --> 01:11:55,322
Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.

617
01:11:55,499 --> 01:12:00,266
I therefore command
my forces to retreat.

618
01:12:00,437 --> 01:12:05,966
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.

619
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:12,506
Harry Potter,
I now speak directly to you.

620
01:12:12,683 --> 01:12:18,053
On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...

621
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:20,713
...rather than face me yourself.

622
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:24,452
There is no greater dishonor.

623
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:29,588
Join me in the Forbidden
Forest and confront your fate.

624
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:33,428
If you do not do this...

625
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:40,305
...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...

626
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:45,039
...who tries to
conceal you from me.

627
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:06,535
Where is everybody?

628
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,378
Harry.

629
01:13:38,035 --> 01:13:40,799
Oh, come on. What's the matter with you?

630
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,598
Oh, she's passed.

631
01:13:44,408 --> 01:13:46,899
There, she's gone.

632
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,689
Freak!

633
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,330
Come here.

634
01:15:58,508 --> 01:16:00,567
I'm gonna tell Mummy.
You're a freak.

635
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:03,178
You're a freak, Lily!

636
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,938
Come here.

637
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:29,235
She's jealous because she's
ordinary and you're special.

638
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:31,931
That's mean, Severus.

639
01:16:54,764 --> 01:16:56,823
Gryffindor!

640
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,309
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

641
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:16,012
Just like your father.
Lazy. Arrogant.

642
01:17:16,186 --> 01:17:18,017
Don't say a word against my father.

643
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:25,919
Blood shall be spilt...

644
01:17:26,096 --> 01:17:31,090
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

645
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,168
Severus.

646
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:36,228
No. Don't kill me.

647
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:40,240
The prophecy did not
refer to a woman.

648
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,674
It spoke of a boy born
at the end of July.

649
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:45,076
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

650
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:48,845
He intends to hunt them down now,
to kill them.

651
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:53,513
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

652
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:56,784
What will you give me in exchange, Severus?

653
01:17:58,528 --> 01:17:59,578
Anything.

654
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:04,462
Harry. Harry,
you are so loved. So loved.

655
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:08,130
Harry, Mama loves you.

656
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:11,206
Dada loves you.

657
01:18:12,075 --> 01:18:14,236
Harry, be safe.

658
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:15,461
Be strong.

659
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,102
Avada Kedavra!

660
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:26,078
You said you would keep her safe.

661
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:30,283
Lily and James put their faith
in the wrong person, Severus.

662
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:33,320
Rather like you.

663
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:36,932
The boy survives.

664
01:18:36,933 --> 01:18:39,535
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

665
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:41,766
The Dark Lord will return.

666
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:45,499
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger.

667
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:49,042
He has her eyes.

668
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:55,678
If you truly loved her...

669
01:18:58,388 --> 01:19:02,222
No one can know.

670
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:05,042
That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?

671
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:06,111
Your word.

672
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:09,163
When you risk your life every
day to protect the boy?

673
01:19:09,164 --> 01:19:13,068
He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...

674
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:14,934
...and he seems to relish his fame.

675
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:17,972
Don't say a word against my father.

676
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:20,336
James Potter?

677
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,000
Lazy, arrogant.

678
01:19:22,178 --> 01:19:23,509
My father was a great man.

679
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,580
Your father was a swine!

680
01:19:27,417 --> 01:19:29,078
Drink the rest.

681
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:33,279
It will contain the curse to
your hand for the time being.

682
01:19:33,456 --> 01:19:35,390
It will spread, Albus.

683
01:19:35,558 --> 01:19:37,253
How long?

684
01:19:38,228 --> 01:19:40,696
Maybe a year.

685
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:44,159
Don't ignore me, Severus.

686
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:45,724
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

687
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:49,861
We both know Lord Voldemort has
ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

688
01:19:51,941 --> 01:19:56,173
But should he fail,
one should presume the Dark Lord...

689
01:19:56,346 --> 01:19:58,473
...will turn to you.

690
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:05,153
You must be the one
to kill me, Severus.

691
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:07,482
It is the only way.

692
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:12,827
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.

693
01:20:12,996 --> 01:20:15,658
Avada Kedavra.

694
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:23,839
There will come a time when Harry
Potter must be told something.

695
01:20:25,408 --> 01:20:30,607
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

696
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,681
Must be told what?

697
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,875
On the night Lord Voldemort...

698
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:39,249
...went to Godric's
Hollow to kill Harry...

699
01:20:40,256 --> 01:20:42,986
...and Lily Potter cast
herself between them...

700
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,694
... the curse rebounded.

701
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:51,126
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

702
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:56,136
... latched itself onto the
only living thing it could find:

703
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:58,433
Harry himself.

704
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:03,212
There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes.

705
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,613
There's a reason he can look
into Lord Voldemort's mind.

706
01:21:08,985 --> 01:21:15,049
A part of Voldemort
lives inside him.

707
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:24,433
So when the time comes...

708
01:21:25,335 --> 01:21:27,496
...the boy must die?

709
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:31,430
Yes. Yes.

710
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:33,872
He must die.

711
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:57,031
You've kept him alive so that
he can die at the proper moment.

712
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:04,265
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

713
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,843
Don't tell me now that you've
grown to care for the boy?

714
01:22:13,349 --> 01:22:16,614
Expecto Patronum.

715
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,020
Lily.

716
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:34,668
After all this time?

717
01:22:38,074 --> 01:22:40,201
Always.

718
01:22:45,348 --> 01:22:48,340
So when the time comes...

719
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:51,510
...the boy must die?

720
01:22:51,688 --> 01:22:55,055
Yes. He must die.

721
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:58,217
And Voldemort himself must do it.

722
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:00,856
That is essential.

723
01:24:05,895 --> 01:24:06,953
Where've you been?

724
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,293
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

725
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:13,435
Are you mad? No.

726
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,661
You can't give yourself up to him.

727
01:24:20,009 --> 01:24:21,909
What is it, Harry?

728
01:24:23,446 --> 01:24:25,380
What is it you know?

729
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:30,745
There's a reason I can hear them...

730
01:24:31,354 --> 01:24:32,582
...the Horcruxes.

731
01:24:35,091 --> 01:24:37,457
I think I've known for a while.

732
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:41,159
And I think you have too.

733
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:47,296
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

734
01:24:48,037 --> 01:24:50,164
Kill the snake and
then it's just him.

735
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,411
I'm ready to die.

736
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:56,163
The Resurrection Stone.

737
01:27:25,828 --> 01:27:29,229
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

738
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:35,167
Why are you here?

739
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:37,769
All of you?

740
01:27:40,143 --> 01:27:42,304
We never left.

741
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:52,779
Does it...?

742
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:54,717
Does it hurt?

743
01:27:55,758 --> 01:27:57,453
Dying?

744
01:27:58,394 --> 01:28:00,919
Quicker than falling asleep.

745
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:07,132
You're nearly there, son.

746
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:08,497
I'm sorry.

747
01:28:08,671 --> 01:28:12,163
I never wanted any
of you to die for me.

748
01:28:13,776 --> 01:28:15,368
And, Remus, your son...

749
01:28:15,545 --> 01:28:19,811
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

750
01:28:19,982 --> 01:28:23,440
One day, he'll understand.

751
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:36,722
You'll stay with me?

752
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:40,565
Until the end.

753
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,238
And he won't be able to see you?

754
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:45,067
No.

755
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,969
We're here, you see.

756
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:05,551
Stay close to me.

757
01:29:07,296 --> 01:29:09,457
Always.

758
01:29:24,213 --> 01:29:27,944
No sign of him, my Lord.

759
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:46,163
I thought he would come.

760
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:30,672
Harry? No! What are you doing here?

761
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:32,143
Quiet!

762
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,423
Harry Potter.

763
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:51,227
The Boy Who Lived.

764
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:57,905
Come to die.

765
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:17,820
Avada Kedavra!

766
01:32:14,517 --> 01:32:15,916
You can't help.

767
01:32:16,852 --> 01:32:17,902
Harry...

768
01:32:18,487 --> 01:32:20,751
...you wonderful boy.

769
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:25,159
You brave, brave man.

770
01:32:27,129 --> 01:32:29,097
Let us walk.

771
01:32:36,572 --> 01:32:38,802
Professor, what is that?

772
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,536
Something beyond
either of our help.

773
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:50,681
A part of Voldemort
sent here to die.

774
01:32:51,053 --> 01:32:52,313
And exactly where are we?

775
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:57,481
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

776
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,389
Well...

777
01:32:59,562 --> 01:33:02,156
... it looks like
King's Cross station.

778
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:04,829
Only cleaner.

779
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,230
And without all the trains.

780
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,500
King's Cross, is that right?

781
01:33:10,873 --> 01:33:14,434
This is, as they say, your party.

782
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:18,603
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

783
01:33:18,781 --> 01:33:21,614
... have been connected by
something other than fate...

784
01:33:21,784 --> 01:33:24,810
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.

785
01:33:24,987 --> 01:33:26,716
So it's true then, sir?

786
01:33:26,889 --> 01:33:29,858
A part of him lives within me,
doesn't it?

787
01:33:30,192 --> 01:33:31,242
Did.

788
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:36,194
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

789
01:33:37,266 --> 01:33:41,965
You were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

790
01:33:54,517 --> 01:33:56,041
I have to go back, haven't l?

791
01:33:56,218 --> 01:33:58,118
Oh. That's up to you.

792
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:00,050
I have a choice?

793
01:34:00,222 --> 01:34:02,019
Oh, yes.

794
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:05,024
We're in King's Cross, you say?

795
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:10,929
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

796
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:13,665
And where would it take me?

797
01:34:15,237 --> 01:34:17,068
On.

798
01:34:35,057 --> 01:34:37,150
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

799
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:40,845
True.

800
01:34:40,996 --> 01:34:43,794
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

801
01:34:43,966 --> 01:34:46,526
And I've nothing to kill it with.

802
01:34:47,069 --> 01:34:51,802
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

803
01:34:53,008 --> 01:34:56,705
I've always prized myself on
my ability to turn a phrase.

804
01:34:57,646 --> 01:35:00,774
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...

805
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,545
...our most inexhaustible source of magic...

806
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:09,054
...capable of both inflicting
injury and remedying it.

807
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:15,597
But I would, in this case,
amend my original statement to this:

808
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:24,566
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who deserve it.

809
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:33,176
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

810
01:35:33,616 --> 01:35:35,641
Pity the living.

811
01:35:36,218 --> 01:35:41,087
And, above all, all those
who live without love.

812
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:47,461
Professor, my mother's
Patronus was a doe, wasn't it?

813
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,124
That's the same as
Professor Snape's.

814
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:54,094
It's curious, don't you think?

815
01:35:54,269 --> 01:35:59,229
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

816
01:36:00,943 --> 01:36:03,104
I'll be going now, Harry.

817
01:36:03,646 --> 01:36:04,977
Professor?

818
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:11,646
Is this all real?

819
01:36:12,321 --> 01:36:14,311
Or is it just happening
inside my head?

820
01:36:14,323 --> 01:36:17,850
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

821
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:21,793
Why should that mean
that it's not real?

822
01:36:27,369 --> 01:36:30,964
Professor? What should I do?

823
01:36:34,743 --> 01:36:36,506
Professor?

824
01:36:39,882 --> 01:36:41,179
My Lord?

825
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:43,477
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

826
01:36:43,652 --> 01:36:45,279
I don't need your help.

827
01:36:45,454 --> 01:36:48,150
No. Come.

828
01:36:56,865 --> 01:36:58,696
The boy.

829
01:36:58,867 --> 01:37:00,801
Is he dead?

830
01:37:14,883 --> 01:37:17,078
Is he alive?

831
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:19,447
Draco, is he alive?

832
01:37:46,115 --> 01:37:48,015
Dead.

833
01:39:14,803 --> 01:39:17,431
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

834
01:39:18,106 --> 01:39:19,937
Neville, who is it?

835
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:23,100
Harry Potter...

836
01:39:24,246 --> 01:39:25,736
...is dead.

837
01:39:25,914 --> 01:39:27,472
No! No!

838
01:39:27,649 --> 01:39:29,014
Silence.

839
01:39:32,821 --> 01:39:34,812
Stupid girl.

840
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:39,394
Harry Potter is dead.

841
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:44,692
From this day forth,
you put your faith...

842
01:39:44,867 --> 01:39:45,925
...in me.

843
01:39:56,411 --> 01:39:58,743
Harry Potter is dead!

844
01:40:03,585 --> 01:40:07,043
And now is the time
to declare yourself.

845
01:40:08,624 --> 01:40:11,354
Come forward and join us.

846
01:40:13,295 --> 01:40:14,990
Or die.

847
01:40:20,535 --> 01:40:21,585
Draco.

848
01:40:27,242 --> 01:40:29,107
Draco.

849
01:40:32,014 --> 01:40:33,914
Draco...

850
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:38,652
...come.

851
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:53,067
Ah. Well done, Draco.

852
01:40:53,869 --> 01:40:55,734
Well done.

853
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:21,057
Well, I must say I'd
hoped for better.

854
01:41:25,467 --> 01:41:28,368
And who might you be, young man?

855
01:41:29,638 --> 01:41:31,572
Neville Longbottom.

856
01:41:36,878 --> 01:41:40,575
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

857
01:41:40,749 --> 01:41:42,979
I'd like to say something.

858
01:41:49,124 --> 01:41:54,892
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

859
01:41:55,130 --> 01:42:00,568
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

860
01:42:00,569 --> 01:42:03,163
People die every day.

861
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,901
Friends, family.

862
01:42:10,946 --> 01:42:12,504
Yeah.

863
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:16,110
We lost Harry tonight.

864
01:42:17,652 --> 01:42:22,146
But he's still with us, in here.

865
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:25,092
So's Fred...

866
01:42:26,094 --> 01:42:27,857
...and Remus.

867
01:42:28,964 --> 01:42:30,295
Tonks.

868
01:42:31,633 --> 01:42:33,533
All of them.

869
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:36,967
They didn't die in vain.

870
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,168
But you will.

871
01:42:43,345 --> 01:42:45,711
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

872
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:48,873
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us.

873
01:42:49,051 --> 01:42:50,643
This is not over!

874
01:42:54,756 --> 01:42:56,587
Confringo!

875
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,458
No! No, come back!

876
01:43:06,635 --> 01:43:10,571
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!

877
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,798
Come back!

878
01:43:17,846 --> 01:43:21,009
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

879
01:43:21,183 --> 01:43:23,083
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

880
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:19,150
Not my daughter, you bitch.

881
01:46:52,627 --> 01:46:53,958
You were right...

882
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:58,062
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

883
01:46:58,233 --> 01:46:59,894
It will always fail you.

884
01:47:01,202 --> 01:47:02,760
I killed Snape.

885
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:05,227
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

886
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:08,107
What if its allegiance was
always to someone else?

887
01:47:08,276 --> 01:47:11,473
Come on, Tom. Let's finish
this the way we started it.

888
01:47:11,946 --> 01:47:12,996
Together.

889
01:50:44,993 --> 01:50:49,630
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.

890
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:53,965
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

891
01:50:54,135 --> 01:50:56,126
It was lost in the
folds of my gowns.

892
01:50:56,304 --> 01:50:59,102
I managed to find it and I
dispatched a few of them...

893
01:50:59,274 --> 01:51:00,502
Harry.

894
01:52:00,969 --> 01:52:04,666
Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?

895
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,574
It answered to somebody else.

896
01:52:07,575 --> 01:52:11,478
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

897
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:15,643
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

898
01:52:15,817 --> 01:52:20,311
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

899
01:52:20,488 --> 01:52:24,515
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

900
01:52:25,393 --> 01:52:27,224
Until...

901
01:52:27,395 --> 01:52:31,957
...the other night when I
disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

902
01:52:32,133 --> 01:52:34,260
So that means...

903
01:52:35,803 --> 01:52:37,566
It's mine.

904
01:52:39,707 --> 01:52:40,969
What should we do with it?

905
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:43,172
We?

906
01:52:43,578 --> 01:52:47,810
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

907
01:52:47,982 --> 01:52:51,918
With that, we'd be invincible.

908
01:55:15,062 --> 01:55:16,723
Together.

909
01:55:34,048 --> 01:55:36,209
Look after each other.

910
01:55:55,403 --> 01:55:57,166
- Bag?
- Yeah.

911
01:55:57,338 --> 01:55:58,396
Jumper?

912
01:56:00,074 --> 01:56:02,065
I'll miss you.

913
01:56:03,177 --> 01:56:04,906
Here they come.

914
01:56:20,094 --> 01:56:24,292
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

915
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:29,127
Albus Severus Potter...

916
01:56:30,404 --> 01:56:34,135
...you were named after two
headmasters of Hogwarts.

917
01:56:34,308 --> 01:56:35,900
One of them was a Slytherin...

918
01:56:36,077 --> 01:56:39,308
...and he was the bravest
man I've ever known.

919
01:56:41,182 --> 01:56:42,444
But just say that I am.

920
01:56:42,617 --> 01:56:48,214
Then Slytherin House will have
gained a wonderful young wizard.

921
01:56:48,389 --> 01:56:54,089
But, listen, if it really means that
much to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

922
01:56:54,262 --> 01:56:57,197
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

923
01:56:57,798 --> 01:56:59,823
- Really?
- Really.

924
01:57:01,202 --> 01:57:03,864
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

925
01:57:04,038 --> 01:57:05,088
Ready?

926
01:57:05,239 --> 01:57:06,797
Ready.

927
01:57:19,053 --> 01:57:20,680
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

928
01:57:20,855 --> 01:57:22,322
Come on.
