1
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,900
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

2
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,950
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

3
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,680
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

4
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,850
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

5
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,730
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

6
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,720
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,100
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,690
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,190
What is it?

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,480
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,320
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,700
I will if she does.

14
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,990
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,040
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,160
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,670
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,220
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,180
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,640
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,760
Okay.

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,020
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,980
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,150
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
A bit more.

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,570
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,370
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,460
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,670
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,970
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,970
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,470
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,440
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,310
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,070
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,700
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,790
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,120
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,290
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,300
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,010
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,100
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,100
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,520
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,900
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,860
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,070
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,950
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,710
Right.

52
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,000
Let me tell you...

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,570
Vernon!

54
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,400
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,870
Stop!

56
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,000
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,420
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,500
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,550
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,470
Oh, God.

61
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,430
Marge!

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,690
Please!

63
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,520
Marge!

64
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,780
Come back!

65
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,180
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,600
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,190
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,400
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,900
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,400
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,370
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,920
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,050
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,220
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,140
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

76
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,020
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,400
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,570
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,490
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,500
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,670
Come on.

82
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,310
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,320
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,740
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,720
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,390
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,520
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,020
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,980
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,030
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,950
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,660
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,450
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,760
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,680
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,140
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,140
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,310
Yes!

99
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,020
Who is that?

100
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,610
That man.

101
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,070
Who is that?

102
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,780
Who is...?

103
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,370
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,200
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,790
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,580
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,670
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,390
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,390
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,970
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,720
Yeah.

113
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,230
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,570
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,730
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,780
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,580
Mind your head.

118
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,420
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,800
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,060
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,900
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,900
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,620
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,640
Room 11.

125
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,560
Hedwig.

126
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,560
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,440
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,990
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,370
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,500
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,420
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,380
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,260
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,010
So that's that...

135
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,060
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,060
Pea soup?

137
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,360
No, thank you.

138
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,730
- Minister?
- Yes?

139
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,650
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,410
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,620
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,330
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,840
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,460
...was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,470
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,470
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,390
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,520
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,860
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,990
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,160
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,290
Hedwig.

153
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,540
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,300
...wander.

155
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,760
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,590
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,260
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,270
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,150
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,400
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,570
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,280
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

163
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,990
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,580
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,370
Harry.

166
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,880
Harry.

167
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,130
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,670
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,050
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,390
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,980
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,560
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

173
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,850
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,440
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,780
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

176
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,280
- Got everything?
- Yes.

177
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,610
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

178
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,200
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

179
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,780
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,830
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,500
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,330
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,130
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,050
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,890
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,390
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,140
You are in danger.

188
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,270
Grave danger.

189
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,400
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,610
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,490
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,990
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,500
Sorry.

195
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,580
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,380
...Black lost everything.

197
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,840
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,180
And in his mind...

199
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,350
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,270
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,600
And that is why...

202
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,310
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,360
To find you.

204
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,440
And kill me.

205
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,070
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,780
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,490
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,660
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,080
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,210
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,670
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,800
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

214
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,430
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

215
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,180
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,100
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,310
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,230
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,440
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,490
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,780
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,080
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,670
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,500
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,060
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,060
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

227
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,230
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,110
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

229
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,610
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,780
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,870
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,660
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,130
What's going on?

234
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,010
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,260
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,060
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,700
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,770
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,470
Harry.

240
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,390
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,230
Thank you.

242
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,860
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,480
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,870
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,450
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,330
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,130
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,630
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,770
What happened to me?

250
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,680
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,020
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,570
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,070
...you know...

254
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,320
...pass out?
- No.

255
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,200
I felt weird, though.

256
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,200
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,660
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,210
A woman.

259
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,170
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,100
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,360
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,860
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,280
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,910
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,580
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,290
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,210
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,050
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,890
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,060
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

271
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,600
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,690
...has decided to retire...

273
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,610
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,530
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,530
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,030
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,090
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,800
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:08,180
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,310
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,940
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,770
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,610
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,110
...a word of caution.

285
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,490
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,080
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,870
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,670
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,550
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,970
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,770
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,860
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,870
<i>Fortuna Major.</i>

294
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,380
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,500
<i>- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.</i>

296
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,510
Watch this.

297
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,230
<i>- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.</i>

298
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,980
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

299
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,990
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,320
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

301
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,700
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,120
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

303
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,250
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,710
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

305
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,090
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,880
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,730
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

308
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,020
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,320
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

310
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,450
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,330
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

312
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,620
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:27,090
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,470
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,260
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,310
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,060
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,940
What do you see?

319
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,780
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,410
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,120
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

322
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,210
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,040
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

324
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,500
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,630
I think so.

326
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,590
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,970
Pity.

328
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,810
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,730
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,820
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,240
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,110
Yeah.

333
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,370
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,460
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,000
So...

336
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,210
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,750
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,220
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,970
My dear...

340
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,730
...you have the Grim.

341
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,310
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,360
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,690
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,360
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,570
It's an omen...

346
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,570
...of death."

347
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,920
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,040
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,880
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,180
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,010
A fair few.

352
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,260
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,230
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,390
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,940
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,360
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,490
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,490
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,010
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,680
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,470
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,560
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,740
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,620
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,290
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,170
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,460
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,020
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,120
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,740
Yeah.

372
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,760
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,590
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,850
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,520
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,600
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,520
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,070
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,700
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,870
Come on now.

382
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,750
Now...

383
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,670
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,710
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,340
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,630
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,010
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,720
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,980
Nice and low.

390
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,980
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,360
Keep still.

392
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,030
Keep still.

393
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,630
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,680
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,610
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,360
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,700
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

399
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,080
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,290
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

401
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,290
That's it...

402
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,250
Yes!

403
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,260
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,430
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,010
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

406
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,770
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,100
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,150
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,590
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,710
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,300
Oh, please.

412
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,430
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,310
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,940
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,520
Malfoy, no...

416
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,900
No!

417
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,240
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

419
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,530
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,990
Away, you silly creature...

421
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,290
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,710
Hagrid!

423
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:29,090
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,010
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

425
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,470
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,000
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,040
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,550
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,760
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,260
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,180
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,230
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

433
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,150
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,190
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,240
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,910
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

437
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,410
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,160
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,130
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,320
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,330
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,290
...as to what is inside?

443
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,500
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,170
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,420
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

446
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,130
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,550
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,180
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,850
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,980
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,780
<i>After me. Riddikulus!</i>

452
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,110
<i>- Riddikulus!
- Very good.</i>

453
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,830
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,240
<i>- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!</i>

455
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,540
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,750
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,670
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,300
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,600
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,140
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,810
Come on.

462
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,770
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,650
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,690
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,280
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,950
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,040
No...

468
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,670
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,130
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,420
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,470
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,970
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,350
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,270
Can you do that?

475
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,560
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,400
One, two, three.

477
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,080
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,880
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

479
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,090
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,220
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,770
Form a line!

482
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,360
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,650
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,570
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,330
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,340
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,920
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

488
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,430
Yes!

489
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,930
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,270
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,270
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,950
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,080
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

494
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,080
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,000
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,140
Here!

497
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,820
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

498
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,250
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,420
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,210
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,420
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,010
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,140
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,230
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,980
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,690
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,110
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,780
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,450
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,830
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,710
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,170
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,020
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,070
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,690
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,700
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,370
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,200
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,910
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,960
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,630
This is very wise.

522
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,880
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,130
...I heard something.

524
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,300
A woman...

525
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,090
...screaming.

526
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,550
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,680
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,730
I think it was my mother...

529
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,110
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,190
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,610
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,200
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,580
Yes.

534
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,910
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,090
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,510
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,010
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,600
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,940
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,110
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,820
...he...

542
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,660
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:22,460
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,420
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,380
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,220
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,980
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,190
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,070
What's going on?

550
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,690
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,280
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,740
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,040
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,370
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,880
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,420
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,510
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,600
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:28,980
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,150
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,230
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,330
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,760
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,050
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,010
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,850
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,100
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,690
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,150
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:23,120
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,040
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,670
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,080
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:37,420
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:10,410
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,170
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,290
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,130
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,840
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,430
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,890
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,730
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,770
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,940
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,730
You may recall...

586
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,740
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,990
...about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:46,240
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,830
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

590
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:52,620
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,130
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,960
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,550
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:10,350
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,020
Turn to page 394.

596
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,030
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,160
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,200
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:17,460
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,960
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,050
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,430
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,810
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,940
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,560
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,190
No one?

607
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,610
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,990
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,700
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,830
With each full moon...

611
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,870
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,670
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,590
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,090
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,260
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,760
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,480
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,270
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,190
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,950
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,370
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,620
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,580
Page 394.

624
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,050
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,470
<i>...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...</i>

626
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,640
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,640
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:01,850
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,020
...being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,460
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,090
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

632
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,470
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,930
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,970
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,220
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,860
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,020
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,780
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,410
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,540
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,580
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,880
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,710
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:21,600
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,600
Well...

646
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,140
<i>I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.</i>

647
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,100
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,650
No.

649
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:35,150
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,650
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,990
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,450
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,580
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:56,010
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,260
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,550
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,310
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,560
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,230
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,360
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:23,240
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:28,540
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,370
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,460
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:04,200
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,890
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

669
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,890
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,270
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,140
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.

672
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,900
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,110
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,650
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,740
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:49,240
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

677
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:52,330
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,250
George, if you will.

679
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,710
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,930
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,300
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,810
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:18,190
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,820
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,320
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,450
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,490
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

688
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,700
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:29,990
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,160
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

691
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,080
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,920
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,250
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,260
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:47,840
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:52,350
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,890
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,100
Delicious.

699
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:51,200
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,030
Twice.

701
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:56,080
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,000
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:01,170
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,170
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,840
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:10,340
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,760
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

708
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:19,190
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:22,810
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,980
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,740
Who is that?

712
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:39,330
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

713
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,440
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,820
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,610
Move!

716
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:12,070
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,790
Harry!

718
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:22,000
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,420
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:30,050
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:34,260
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,930
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,430
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

724
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,480
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,020
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:45,060
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,190
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,280
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:56,490
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

730
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,120
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,910
And what would bring him here?

732
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,250
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

733
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,170
Come.

734
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,720
Harry!

735
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:25,900
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,110
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

737
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,940
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

738
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,320
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,990
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,080
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,670
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:51,300
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

743
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,130
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:58,180
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:01,600
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,140
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,560
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,980
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

749
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,980
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,900
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:19,240
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,290
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,660
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:31,040
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:34,260
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,630
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

757
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,680
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

758
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:44,640
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,980
...and remains to this day...

760
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,060
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,990
Ron, look!

762
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,290
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,580
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,210
He was their friend...

765
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,960
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,710
He was their friend!

767
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,930
I hope he finds me.

768
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,890
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,970
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,870
<i>Harry.</i>

771
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:27,030
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

772
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,290
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,920
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,630
I'm sure.

775
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,670
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,300
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:43,970
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,800
No? Well...

779
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:49,560
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,400
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,400
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:02,530
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,530
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,950
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,620
Concentrate.

786
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,960
Explore your past.

787
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,340
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,130
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,930
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:31,600
<i>Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.</i>

791
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,850
<i>- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.</i>

792
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,980
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,420
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

794
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,550
<i>Expecto... Expecto...</i>

795
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,510
<i>Expect...</i>

796
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:14,600
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:18,690
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:24,240
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,950
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,910
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,250
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:37,040
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:40,920
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:45,460
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:57,600
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,650
Well, it is.

807
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,400
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:08,530
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

809
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:15,750
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,290
Just do it.

811
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,600
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

812
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:37,810
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

813
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,500
Yes!

814
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,880
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:10,550
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,140
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,100
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:19,270
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:21,480
...is saying something.

820
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,650
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,980
And Mum.

822
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,400
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:33,740
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,160
Just talking.

825
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,660
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:42,750
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,420
But it's the best I have.

828
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,970
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,140
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,730
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:05,060
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:07,360
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

833
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,860
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:14,950
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:17,990
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,240
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

837
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:21,910
- Did.
- Didn't.

838
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,580
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:30,050
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,880
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,430
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,560
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,810
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,190
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:50,400
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,400
And then?

847
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:55,820
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:55,990 --> 01:13:00,120
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,210
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:37,610
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,370
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

852
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:44,540
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

853
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,850
<i>- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.</i>

854
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,140
<i>- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.</i>

855
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,810
<i>He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!</i>

856
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,370
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

857
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:09,750
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,550
<i>Mischief managed. Nox.</i>

859
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,100
Potter.

860
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,770
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,100
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:31,810
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,730
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:41,280
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:45,120
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,540
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,830
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,380
What's this?

869
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,800
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:13,060
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,320
Read it.

872
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:26,280
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:30,580
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

874
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,370
Go on.

875
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:37,420
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:40,170
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

877
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,510
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,390
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

879
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,180
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,850
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,440
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:04,150
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,120
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,790
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:16,830
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,250
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,550
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,050
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,810
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,360
Come in.

891
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:50,370
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:55,040
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,870
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,040
...is a map to you?

895
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,340
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,390
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,890
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,600
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:23,230
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,610
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:28,240
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,070
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,000
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:46,090
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,930
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:55,100
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,810
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,520
That's not possible.

909
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,400
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:08,940
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:16,620
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:22,210
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:25,710
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,340
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:32,890
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,270
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:44,520
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:48,480
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:52,570
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:56,410
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:00,580
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,870
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:21,390
Have I said something?

924
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:31,070
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,820
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:36,160
Hang on.

927
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,240
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:43,000
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:26,040
<i>Harry Potter...</i>

930
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,180
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

931
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,970
Sorry?

932
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:43,810
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,020
...shall break free.

934
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:48,440
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,610
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:04,200
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,790
No.

938
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:08,790
Nothing.

939
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:05,430
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,350
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

941
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:12,690
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:15,320
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,690
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

944
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,990
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,910
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:25,740
He's not worth it.

947
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,880
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:46,310
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:50,890
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:14,630
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,090
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,670
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,840
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:25,390
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

955
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:28,430
When it happens.

956
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,930
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,480
A great man.

958
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,940
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:41,280
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,110
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

961
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,920
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,790
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,720
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:03,970
I meant me!

965
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,890
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,770
Hagrid!

967
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,020
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,230
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:26,530
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,490
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:34,250
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:38,080
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,000
Hagrid.

974
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:44,090
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

975
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:48,720
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

976
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,560
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,430
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,480
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,150
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,700
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:11,450
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:14,790
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:20,460
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:24,170
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,760
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

986
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:30,680
What?

987
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,930
I thought I just saw...

988
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,220
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,650
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,610
Oh, no.

991
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,750
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,300
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:50,800
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,050
Wait!

995
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:04,270
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,730
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,400
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:14,620
It's the Grim!

999
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:24,670
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,880
Harry!

1001
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,840
- Help!
- Ron!

1002
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:36,220
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:53,070
Come on!

1004
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,410
Move!

1005
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:02,200
Duck!

1006
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:40,370
Harry!

1007
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:59,260
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:03,350
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1009
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:05,390
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,250
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:30,960
Come on.

1012
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,720
Ron.

1013
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,890
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,310
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,000
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,960
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,080
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,470
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,510
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1020
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:29,390
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,650
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:36,860
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:48,330
- I found him.
- I know.

1024
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,790
- It's him.
- I understand.

1025
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,170
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,340
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:01,090
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,600
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,310
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,440
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,020
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,860
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1033
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:20,440
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:23,450
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,670
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:39,000
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:40,760
I know why.

1038
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,220
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,300
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,390
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,060
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:55,730
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,020
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,490
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:05,660
<i>- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!</i>

1046
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:11,120
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,540
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,040
Severus...

1049
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:19,960
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:21,460
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:26,010
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:28,890
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:34,060
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,810
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,610
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:41,190
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,900
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:46,950
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:53,040
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,920
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,590
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:05,170
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,640
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,680
After you.

1065
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,850
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1066
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:22,190
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,990
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,820
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:29,990
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1070
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,370
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:36,370
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,540
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,590
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,010
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,680
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:54,430
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1077
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,560
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:01,020
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,230
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1080
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,910
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:11,160
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,410
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,730
Remus?

1084
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,980
Sirius.

1085
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,060
My old friends!

1086
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:52,530
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:56,370
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,830
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:05,250
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,260
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:11,090
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:17,060
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:21,600
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:27,480
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:32,150
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,410
No!

1097
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:39,870
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1098
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,960
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:47,170
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1100
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:50,710
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:53,300
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:57,220 --> 01:37:00,980
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:04,690
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,400
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,400
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:15,820
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:20,870
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:34,930
Okay.

1109
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:42,480
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,060
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,810
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,230
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:54,820
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1114
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:57,570
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:58,030 --> 01:38:00,700
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:05,080
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:08,170
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,760
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:16,630
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,600
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:24,560
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:27,900
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:29,610
...to become killers.

1124
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:33,480
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:36,030
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,280
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:42,830
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:45,500
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:49,710
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1130
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:54,090
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,340
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,470
I know.

1133
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:05,680
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,350
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1135
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,020
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:15,480
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:17,240
Harry!

1138
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:36,340
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:43,010
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,350
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,600
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1142
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,240
Harry!

1143
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,280
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,830
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,890
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:31,140
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:33,560
Professor?

1148
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:39,190
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:50,200
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:53,170
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:27,990
Sirius!

1152
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:31,250
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,480
Sirius!

1154
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:42,230
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,990
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1156
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:42,160
Harry?

1157
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,460
I saw my dad.

1158
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:47,210
What?

1159
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:48,960
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,550
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,380
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:55,430
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:58,100
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1164
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,140
Much worse.

1165
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:02,680
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:05,770
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:09,320
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,690
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:13,240
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:17,450
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:21,330
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:24,040
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:29,670
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,550
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,470
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,230
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,730
Powerful...

1178
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:52,780
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,990
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:00,910
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,870
You must not be seen.

1182
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,710
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:10,420
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,750
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:15,760
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:19,800
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,520
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:32,520
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:34,780
Good luck.

1190
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,740
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,740
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1192
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:11,350
What just happened?

1193
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,810
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:15,860
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:17,820
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:20,360
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:23,280
Hermione!

1198
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:44,140
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:49,520
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:52,560
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:52,730 --> 01:48:54,060
That's us.

1202
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:57,190
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:58,860
This is not normal.

1204
01:49:01,150 --> 01:49:03,530
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:05,910
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,410
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,830
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1208
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,380
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:21,840
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:26,300
Good punch.

1211
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:27,970
Thanks.

1212
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:30,640
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,890
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:37,440
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:41,530
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,490
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:07,180
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,510
Of course.

1219
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,680
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:16,900
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:18,610
Let's go.

1222
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,000
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:44,670
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:47,300
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,720
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:53,680
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,810
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:59,980
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:06,570
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:09,570
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:12,620
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:15,040
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:20,040
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,050
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:26,800
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:39,270
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,650
That hurt.

1238
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,200
Sorry.

1239
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:11,720
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:31,950
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:35,330
What?

1242
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,040
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,920
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:57,520
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:05,730
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,340
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:35,340
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1248
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:39,350
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:46,520
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:52,700
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:56,820
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1252
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,910
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:04,580
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:07,080
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:14,220
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,090
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1257
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:19,680
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:23,350
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,350
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:30,190
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,530
- Over there.
- Where?

1262
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:33,440
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:36,320
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1264
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:39,700
But where is it?

1265
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:42,830
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:45,660
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:47,170
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:51,460
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:52,960
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:57,430
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,470
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:02,520
- Right.
- Well, well.

1273
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:04,230
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:07,440
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:13,030
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:17,200
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,240
Thank you.

1278
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:22,740
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,010
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,600
This way, now.

1281
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,770
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:50,480
- How?
- No idea.

1283
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:02,160
<i>- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!</i>

1284
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,580
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,470
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,470
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:52,290
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1288
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:56,880
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1289
01:56:57,050 --> 01:57:01,380
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:03,680
...I did see someone.

1291
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,260
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:08,770
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:10,850
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,480
According to him...

1295
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:16,070
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:18,110
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,030
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,450
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:27,200
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:31,330 --> 01:57:32,960
Here we come.

1301
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:41,010
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:44,010
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1303
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:47,510
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:49,310
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:49,970 --> 01:57:51,930
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,730
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:57,730
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:00,320
Harry!

1309
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:03,570
Run!

1310
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:12,000
Let's go.

1311
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,890
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1312
01:58:38,150 --> 01:58:39,520
Thanks.

1313
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:45,400
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,270
That was so scary.

1315
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:05,400
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:19,960
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:38,100
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
02:00:38,270 --> 02:00:41,480
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:52,030
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:54,280
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:58,160
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
02:00:58,330 --> 02:01:00,870
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,460
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1324
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:11,380
...both of you.

1325
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:15,180
Harry!

1326
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:20,980
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1327
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:21,160
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:21,330 --> 02:02:24,670
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:27,590
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:30,130
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:32,010
...well, I had already done it.

1332
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:34,630
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,640
But I don't like flying...!

1334
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,110
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1335
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:28,230
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,730
...to both of you.

1337
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:32,820
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:35,900
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:37,820
And besides...

1340
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:42,030
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,330
And you know it.

1342
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:47,290
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:52,170
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:53,170 --> 02:03:55,710
...but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:59,430
Except your eyes.

1346
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:02,680
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:09,730
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:10,310 --> 02:04:11,810
But know this:

1349
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:16,110
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:17,490 --> 02:04:19,450
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,700
...in here.

1352
02:04:34,090 --> 02:04:36,630
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:05,080
We have to go.

1354
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:36,020
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1355
02:05:36,190 --> 02:05:37,730
Did what?

1356
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:39,860
Good night.

1357
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,950
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:52,790
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:55,750
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1360
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,460
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,450
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,910
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:40,170
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,050
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1365
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:49,180
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:51,140
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:51,310 --> 02:06:56,600
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:56,770 --> 02:07:02,280
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:05,820
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:07,950
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1371
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,990
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:13,410
Besides, people like me are...

1373
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:17,370
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:29,510
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:31,850
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:35,560
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:07:35,730 --> 02:07:39,230
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,900
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:44,780
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,620
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:54,450
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:57,370
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:01,790
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:05,210
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,970
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:09,840
Until then...

1387
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:12,890
...mischief managed.

1388
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:51,340
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:52,930
Harry.

1390
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,140
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:57,730
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:57,890 --> 02:09:00,060
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1393
02:09:00,230 --> 02:09:03,520
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:03,690 --> 02:09:06,190
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:07,860
Did not.

1396
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:12,740
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:14,450
For me?

1398
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:17,160
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1399
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:19,250
This came with it.

1400
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,750
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:27,760
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:48,730
Lumos.

1403
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:51,320
<i>I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.</i>

1404
02:21:10,523 --> 02:21:12,320
<i>Mischief managed.</i>

1405
02:21:18,098 --> 02:21:19,531
<i>Nox.</i>
