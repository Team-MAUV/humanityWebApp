1
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,949
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,455
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,322
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:08,157
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...

5
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:11,165
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:14,065
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,931
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,345
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:25,881
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

10
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,911
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:32,614
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,620
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:37,152
Beat up another
10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,818
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:44,630
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:50,069
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:55,076
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:57,173
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:02,475
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,150
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,618
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,856
She dead?

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,657
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,530
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:31,545
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:36,283
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:39,423
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,114
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,411
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,481
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,109
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,078
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,754
They might come back.

34
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,993
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?

35
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,120
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,495
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,069
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,072
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,904
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,740
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,043
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:22,882
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,664
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,961
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,037
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,398
Is that you?

47
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,740
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,949
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,245
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,421
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,423
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,395
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,936
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,263
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,275
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,284
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,693
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:43,600
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,863
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,102
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,405
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,304
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:01,421
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,891
Justice.

65
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,337
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,653
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,656
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:48,895
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,426
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,896
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,506
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,113
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,272
But the letter said...

74
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:10,477
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:12,815
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:16,356
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,824
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:22,828
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:32,301
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,117
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,629
Come on.

82
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,834
In you go, son.

83
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,864
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:13,773
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:16,813
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:20,917
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,622
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,193
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:33,559
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:36,895
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:41,505
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:47,775
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,905
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,152
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:05,456
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,264
Yeah.

97
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:14,733
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:19,775
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:22,243
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:26,273
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:41,394
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,967
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,764
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,277
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:59,915
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:02,918
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:07,287
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,621
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,492
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,627
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,471
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,335
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,632
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:27,371
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,107
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:32,978
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:37,181
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.

118
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:38,412
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,788
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:45,291
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,830
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,971
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,972
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,337
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:57,511 --> 00:14:01,571
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,239
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,885
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,114
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,848
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:15,392
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,630
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,960
He's as good as.

133
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,030
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:25,637
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:28,900
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,838
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,070
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,112
...about your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:38,012
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,880
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,680
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,250
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,688
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:52,325
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,229
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:59,504
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...

147
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:02,699
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,468
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,174
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:09,975
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,311
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:16,319
Sirius.

153
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:24,326
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:28,162
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,772
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:36,108
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:49,512
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:56,353
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,656
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,130
Why?

161
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,270
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:05,565
No one in their right
mind could believe that...

163
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,607
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:11,301
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:15,415
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:18,017
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,520
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,625
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:28,728
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,662
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,466
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:43,202
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:47,839
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:52,550
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,321
We believe...

176
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,261
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:01,521
Sirius.

178
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,034
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:11,529
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:15,768
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:18,743
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,714
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,062
Harry.

184
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:39,496
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:42,466
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,577
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:56,047
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,067
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:21,333
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:26,379
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:09,291
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:12,758
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,921
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:40,686
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:44,885
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:49,021
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:57,607
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:01,142
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,410
In five minutes.

200
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:14,319
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:20,992
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,258
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:33,843
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:37,538
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:41,114
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,984
Yes?

207
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,454
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,856
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:56,323
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,436
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:03,232
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:06,502
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...

213
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:08,509
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,843
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:15,585
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:19,152
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:21,884
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,997
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,161
The charges?

220
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,860
The charges against the
accused are as follows:

221
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:34,666
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,400
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:41,569
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:44,977
...in the presence of a Muggle."

225
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,449
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:52,079
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:52,258 --> 00:21:55,125
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:58,660
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,061
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,430
Dementors?

231
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:07,732
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:10,239
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:13,536
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?

234
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,940
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,675
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:23,049
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:27,716
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:32,489
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:38,929
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,504
What did they look like?

241
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:49,514
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:53,415
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:57,249
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:03,054
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:07,097
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:12,363
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:16,168
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:18,071
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:21,270
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,683
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.

251
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:32,348
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:36,724
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:40,890
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:43,866
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:48,201
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,742
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:55,279
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.

258
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:58,380
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,314
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:08,954
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:13,691
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:16,631
He is not back.

263
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,738
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:27,747
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:32,385
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:35,454
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.

267
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:38,786
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,827
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?

269
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,799
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:07,554
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,933
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,704
Professor.

273
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:44,716
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:47,258
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:58,299
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...

276
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,068
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:05,369
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,912
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,550
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:14,979
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,388
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:25,661
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,394
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,933
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,171
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,833
Neville's parents.

287
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,675
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.

288
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:44,085
It's been 14 years.

289
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:49,118
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:56,458
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:02,161
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:08,206
You keep it.

293
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:13,081
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:17,116
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,312
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,690
I love you.

297
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,449
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,990
There they are. They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:28,460
Bye.

300
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:13,609
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,244
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:18,711
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.

303
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:25,277
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,321
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,990
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,141
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,977
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:08,555
What is it?

309
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:13,999
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,137
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:20,006
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:35,854
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,660
I can see them too.

314
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:44,527
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,399
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:56,112
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:02,383
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:05,081
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,050
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,320
Hungry.

321
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:15,966
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:20,563
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,876
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:38,917
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:42,117
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:44,854
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,488
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:53,328
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:56,669
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:56,976 --> 00:31:00,707
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:31:01,513 --> 00:31:06,508
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...

332
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:20,326
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:26,199
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:31,236
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,243
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:39,812
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,215
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:48,026
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:53,791
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,430
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:56,602 --> 00:32:01,438
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:09,140
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.

343
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:13,717
Let us preserve what must be preserved...

344
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:17,378
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:24,156
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:35,334
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:39,877
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:42,775
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:46,510
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:08,035
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:10,468
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:13,074
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:16,713
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.

354
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:20,183
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:23,988
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:25,489
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,559
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,821
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

359
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:34,490
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:37,160
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:40,432
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,234
Yeah. I do.

363
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,211
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

364
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:57,055
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:33:57,224 --> 00:34:00,022
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:04,360
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:12,438
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.

368
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:41,891
Harry.

369
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,513
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:03,289
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,339
Good morning, children.

372
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:27,508
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:30,277
O-W-Ls.

374
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:35,014
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,319
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:43,928
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.

377
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:54,567
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:56,870
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...

379
00:35:57,045 --> 00:36:00,537
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:03,411
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:07,348
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:09,046
Using spells?

383
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:12,683
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,989
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:21,159
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:24,101
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:27,208
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:33,247
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:36,180
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...

390
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:38,320
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,922
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.

392
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,888
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?

393
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,086
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:49,289
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?

395
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:52,730
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:07,906
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:09,919
You have been told...

398
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:15,457
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.

399
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:20,757
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,558
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,893
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?

402
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:27,502
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

403
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,832
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,474
Enough!

405
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:33,837
Enough.

406
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:38,311
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,267
Come in.

408
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:11,448
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,345
Sit.

410
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:24,961
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:26,993
No, not with your quill.

412
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:30,429
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.

413
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:36,972
Now...

414
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:43,811
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

415
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:47,783
How many times?

416
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:52,883
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.

417
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,553
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:58,218
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,971
Yes?

420
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,691
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:06,553
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:08,790
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:40:09,968 --> 00:40:12,129
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,967
Go on.

425
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:29,283
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,082
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:35,023
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:40:36,028 --> 00:40:37,360
Care for another?

429
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,055
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.

430
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:43,202
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,466
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:49,404
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:53,807
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:00,945
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:02,955
Nothing.

436
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:06,124
The other hand.

437
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:10,458
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:12,825
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.

439
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,126
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:17,735
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.

441
00:41:17,904 --> 00:41:21,840
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:27,112
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,807
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

444
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:33,817
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.

445
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:36,879
You don't understand.

446
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:41,426
Then help us to.

447
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,007
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:41:58,545 --> 00:42:00,274
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:05,044
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:12,420
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:42:13,294 --> 00:42:16,593
I know you, of all people, will understand.

452
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,893
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:42:55,537 --> 00:43:00,166
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:43:01,075 --> 00:43:05,102
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,739
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:18,719
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:24,457
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

458
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:29,028
Different.

459
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:34,505
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:43:34,675 --> 00:43:38,203
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.

461
00:43:40,314 --> 00:43:42,942
So you've known someone who's died, then?

462
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:44,745
My mum.

463
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:50,190
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:53,657
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.

465
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:56,228
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:58,993
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:04,503
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.

468
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:09,369
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:15,439
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

470
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:18,711
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.

471
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:23,257
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.

472
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:24,756
I don't think that's true.

473
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:30,256
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:44:30,432 --> 00:44:32,196
What do you mean?

475
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:34,700
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...

476
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,731
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...

477
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:41,637
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:44,809
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:07,198
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:11,631
Harry.

481
00:45:13,475 --> 00:45:14,704
Can I join you?

482
00:45:16,612 --> 00:45:19,740
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:22,679
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...

484
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:27,118
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:28,950
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:33,255
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...

487
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:34,760
...Minerva.

488
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:39,391
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.

489
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,138
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:45,638
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:48,936
...and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:50,704
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:55,943
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,484
Disloyalty.

495
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:05,183
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.

496
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:08,820
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.

497
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,143
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,872
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,710
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,844
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,522
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,465
Just one question, dear.

503
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:53,837
You've been in this post how long, exactly?

504
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:05,747
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,913
Yes.

506
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,953
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,596
Obviously.

508
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:50,367
Could you please predict something for me?

509
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:53,297
I'm sorry?

510
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,738
Move those mouths.

511
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,978
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,294
Pity.

513
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:20,263
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.

514
00:48:20,432 --> 00:48:22,626
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:27,428
You are in grave danger.

516
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,635
Lovely.

517
00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:42,980
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:45,487
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,812
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:21,926
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,729
You can't do this.

522
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,429
Actually, I can.

523
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,676
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:42,508
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.

525
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:44,640
There...

526
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:03,228
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:07,004
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:08,663
Thank you.

529
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:13,869
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...

530
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:17,312
...of Educational Decree Number
23, as enacted by the minister...

531
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:20,646
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,381
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:50:24,557 --> 00:50:27,583
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:50:29,595 --> 00:50:30,857
For now.

535
00:50:37,303 --> 00:50:39,294
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:50:39,472 --> 00:50:40,632
Professor.

537
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:43,567
Professor?

538
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,842
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:50:47,014 --> 00:50:49,140
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:01,920
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:07,491
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:09,893
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,733
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:17,740
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...

545
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,778
...that these disappearances are the work...

546
00:51:20,948 --> 00:51:24,349
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,643
Harry.

548
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:28,581
Sirius.

549
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:32,019
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:35,093
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,196
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:51:37,363 --> 00:51:40,333
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:44,762
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:45,927
Combat?

555
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,341
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,909
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:51:51,078 --> 00:51:55,014
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:58,848
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.

559
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,677
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:06,057
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.

561
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:08,855
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...

562
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,022
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:17,168
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:18,970
Well, what can we do?

565
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:21,007
Someone's coming.

566
00:52:21,176 --> 00:52:23,371
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:28,539
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.

568
00:52:40,095 --> 00:52:42,427
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:46,927
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.

570
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:51,268
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.

571
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:10,450
Harry.

572
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,401
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:23,798
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:53:23,972 --> 00:53:28,467
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,168
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,012
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:37,311
Just a couple of people.

578
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:43,756
Lovely spot.

579
00:53:47,463 --> 00:53:49,589
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:51,926
Matey, come back here.

581
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:01,536
Hi.

582
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:04,845
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:06,242
We need a teacher.

584
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,111
A proper teacher.

585
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:13,582
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:15,520
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:17,750
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.

588
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:19,485
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:21,789
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:54:21,964 --> 00:54:24,364
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:28,760
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

592
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:35,641
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:54:35,812 --> 00:54:39,247
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:54:39,415 --> 00:54:42,043
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?

595
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:46,788
Yes.

596
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:49,691
I've seen it.

597
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,985
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.

598
00:54:52,662 --> 00:54:56,791
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:54:56,966 --> 00:54:58,195
It's true.

600
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:01,132
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:05,237
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:06,705
Wait.

603
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,937
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:15,676
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.

605
00:55:15,952 --> 00:55:19,683
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:23,348
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:55:25,928 --> 00:55:30,593
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.

608
00:55:31,635 --> 00:55:35,071
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:36,728
But out there...

610
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,639
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...

611
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,507
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

612
00:55:47,284 --> 00:55:49,082
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:00,763
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:03,625
That's why we need your help.

615
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:06,702
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...

616
00:56:08,906 --> 00:56:10,065
...Voldemort...

617
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,240
He's really back.

618
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:39,228
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...

619
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:40,802
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:43,132
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:46,276
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,537
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:49,873
Who cares?

624
00:56:50,481 --> 00:56:55,350
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?

625
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:57,783
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?

626
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:02,153
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

627
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:03,623
What's that?

628
00:57:05,364 --> 00:57:08,026
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?

629
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:13,829
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...

630
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:16,838
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:20,841
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:22,843
Will do, Harry.

633
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:35,719
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:57:35,894 --> 00:57:39,489
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

635
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:42,166
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:22,135
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:58:22,307 --> 00:58:23,433
The what?

638
00:58:23,608 --> 00:58:26,008
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.

639
00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:29,615
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:58:29,782 --> 00:58:32,444
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:36,349
So say you really needed the toilet...

642
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:42,357
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.

643
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:47,397
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.

644
00:58:58,444 --> 00:58:59,933
Expelliarmus.

645
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:06,483
I'm hopeless.

646
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:10,418
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:17,820
You will please copy the
approved text four times...

648
00:59:17,997 --> 00:59:20,989
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:25,064
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:27,263
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,280
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.

652
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:45,687
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:49,420
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:57,335
Stupefy!

655
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:06,679
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
01:00:12,052 --> 01:00:14,145
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:16,511
Thanks, Ronald.

658
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:21,387
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
01:00:21,562 --> 01:00:24,429
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
01:00:24,964 --> 01:00:26,990
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,406
Stupefy.

662
01:00:41,081 --> 01:00:43,049
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:48,047
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?

664
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,815
It was completely intentional.

665
01:01:18,452 --> 01:01:21,387
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?

666
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:27,650
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.

667
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:30,197
Expelliarmus.

668
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:34,326
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
01:01:36,437 --> 01:01:37,927
Great.

670
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:40,799
A little higher.

671
01:01:49,283 --> 01:01:52,116
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:12,767
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:17,709
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

674
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:20,746
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

675
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,542
Diminuendo.

676
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:32,757
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:35,123
Believing in yourself.

678
01:02:35,297 --> 01:02:37,423
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:39,157
Think of it this way.

680
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:43,326
Every great wizard in
history has started out...

681
01:02:43,672 --> 01:02:47,574
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.

682
01:02:47,743 --> 01:02:50,678
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,620
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:06,158
Expelliarmus.

685
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:10,354
Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:17,201
Reducto.

687
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,711
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:36,255
Expelliarmus.

689
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:42,221
Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:49,470
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:53,233
So that's it for this lesson.

692
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:56,809
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.

693
01:03:57,213 --> 01:04:00,239
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.

694
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:03,783
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.

695
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,024
Well done, mate.

696
01:04:10,193 --> 01:04:11,626
Thanks.

697
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,666
See you after Christmas.

698
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:31,171
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:35,278
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:39,420
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:42,256
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:44,290
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,054
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,630
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,461
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

706
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:55,160
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?

707
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:10,849
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:13,387
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:05:14,091 --> 01:05:16,889
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:25,396
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:29,606
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...

712
01:05:29,774 --> 01:05:32,504
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:05:33,078 --> 01:05:35,477
He was really good.

714
01:05:36,114 --> 01:05:38,844
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:05:43,388 --> 01:05:45,185
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:49,359
I've never been able to stun anything before.

717
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:00,164
Mistletoe.

718
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:05,609
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:08,373
What are Nargles?

720
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:10,810
No idea.

721
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:35,034
Well, how was it?

722
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:37,570
Wet.

723
01:06:37,977 --> 01:06:39,740
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:06:40,112 --> 01:06:42,081
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,978
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,981
Cho spends half her time crying these days.

727
01:06:50,156 --> 01:06:52,420
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.

728
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:56,760
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?

729
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:04,625
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:07:04,804 --> 01:07:07,864
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:11,272
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:15,175
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,678
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.

734
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:24,084
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...

735
01:07:39,938 --> 01:07:41,564
Harry.

736
01:07:50,348 --> 01:07:53,408
Voldemort may be after something.

737
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:57,078
Something he didn't have last time.

738
01:07:57,923 --> 01:07:59,184
Harry.

739
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,087
Harry.

740
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:36,594
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...

741
01:08:36,763 --> 01:08:38,252
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:41,700
Neither. It was like I...

743
01:08:42,268 --> 01:08:44,360
Will you please just tell me what's happening?

744
01:08:44,536 --> 01:08:46,868
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,439
Make sure he's found by the right people.

746
01:08:49,608 --> 01:08:51,167
- Sir.
- Phineas.

747
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:53,642
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:56,441
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...

749
01:08:56,616 --> 01:09:00,779
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.

750
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:04,013
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:06,714
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,793
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

753
01:09:08,962 --> 01:09:10,156
Look at me!

754
01:09:16,669 --> 01:09:18,899
What's happening to me?

755
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,645
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:33,718
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.

757
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,021
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

758
01:09:41,795 --> 01:09:43,387
It appears there's a connection...

759
01:09:43,563 --> 01:09:45,895
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.

760
01:09:46,065 --> 01:09:50,230
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,629
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:57,072
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:09:57,544 --> 01:10:01,948
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

764
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,981
...unhinge it.

765
01:10:04,151 --> 01:10:07,518
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:10:07,688 --> 01:10:09,918
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:13,685
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:10:14,828 --> 01:10:19,630
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...

769
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:24,066
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:25,466
...kill them.

771
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,873
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...

772
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:32,535
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:37,479
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.

774
01:10:38,052 --> 01:10:41,146
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:10:41,422 --> 01:10:42,889
Prepare yourself.

776
01:10:45,626 --> 01:10:46,854
Legilimens.

777
01:10:54,969 --> 01:10:58,564
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:11:24,465 --> 01:11:26,093
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

779
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:29,964
Here we go.

780
01:11:30,137 --> 01:11:32,299
Daddy's back.

781
01:11:35,477 --> 01:11:39,105
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,650
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

783
01:11:46,454 --> 01:11:48,649
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:11:48,823 --> 01:11:51,121
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

785
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:53,692
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:11:53,862 --> 01:11:58,162
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:01,200
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:03,394
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:05,471
There you are.

790
01:12:06,474 --> 01:12:08,305
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:12:08,877 --> 01:12:10,743
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:12:10,913 --> 01:12:12,880
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:12:13,048 --> 01:12:14,777
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

794
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,316
Fred? George?

795
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:19,009
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

796
01:12:19,188 --> 01:12:21,052
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:24,924
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:30,829
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,227
Harry.

800
01:12:33,235 --> 01:12:35,828
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.

801
01:12:36,004 --> 01:12:38,370
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:12:39,308 --> 01:12:42,038
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:12:43,511 --> 01:12:45,343
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

804
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:47,345
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:49,380
I don't know why...

806
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:59,987
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.

807
01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:04,895
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:13:05,067 --> 01:13:08,059
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:13:08,504 --> 01:13:11,098
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

810
01:13:11,273 --> 01:13:14,106
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!

811
01:13:14,276 --> 01:13:16,267
Of course, master.

812
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:21,144
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:13:23,452 --> 01:13:25,352
Sorry about that.

814
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:29,584
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:13:29,926 --> 01:13:32,018
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:13:32,863 --> 01:13:34,796
What, you grew up here?

817
01:13:34,964 --> 01:13:37,228
This is my parents' house.

818
01:13:37,566 --> 01:13:41,401
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:13:42,538 --> 01:13:45,803
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.

820
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,576
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,607
My deranged cousin.

822
01:13:52,783 --> 01:13:55,513
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:13:55,685 --> 01:14:00,383
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:14:03,593 --> 01:14:07,393
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:14:09,733 --> 01:14:11,597
Charming woman.

826
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:14,495
I was 16.

827
01:14:15,338 --> 01:14:16,771
Where did you go?

828
01:14:18,842 --> 01:14:20,103
Round your dad's.

829
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:24,136
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:27,778
I see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:14:28,418 --> 01:14:30,613
You are so very much alike.

832
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:33,523
I'm not so sure.

833
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:36,024
Sirius, when I was...

834
01:14:38,862 --> 01:14:43,391
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.

835
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:46,059
I was the snake.

836
01:14:46,903 --> 01:14:49,838
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

837
01:14:50,006 --> 01:14:54,204
...there was a moment when I wanted to...

838
01:14:59,349 --> 01:15:02,216
This connection between me and Voldemort.

839
01:15:02,887 --> 01:15:06,482
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?

840
01:15:07,824 --> 01:15:12,727
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:15:12,896 --> 01:15:17,459
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

842
01:15:17,635 --> 01:15:21,196
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:15:23,841 --> 01:15:27,072
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.

844
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:31,248
You're not a bad person.

845
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:36,451
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.

846
01:15:37,054 --> 01:15:38,180
You understand?

847
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:45,319
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:15:45,496 --> 01:15:49,956
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.

849
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:53,966
What matters is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:15:55,907 --> 01:15:58,205
That's who we really are.

851
01:16:01,946 --> 01:16:03,709
Harry, time to go.

852
01:16:05,483 --> 01:16:09,749
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:11,513
You'll see.

854
01:16:12,657 --> 01:16:14,023
Come on.

855
01:16:51,463 --> 01:16:52,622
Really?

856
01:16:52,797 --> 01:16:55,425
Harry. Harry.

857
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,535
Hagrid's back.

858
01:17:00,472 --> 01:17:02,303
I'm sorry.

859
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,684
I will say this one last time.

860
01:17:19,992 --> 01:17:22,358
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.

861
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:25,553
I told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:17:25,897 --> 01:17:30,062
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:17:30,236 --> 01:17:35,070
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:39,600
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.

865
01:17:39,778 --> 01:17:43,043
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.

866
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:05,095
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:18:06,004 --> 01:18:08,371
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.

868
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,031
Giants?

869
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:12,266
You found them?

870
01:18:12,445 --> 01:18:16,347
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

871
01:18:17,216 --> 01:18:20,241
I tried to convince them to join the cause.

872
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,117
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.

873
01:18:23,823 --> 01:18:25,723
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

874
01:18:26,192 --> 01:18:29,525
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:32,395
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

876
01:18:32,565 --> 01:18:36,661
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:18:40,274 --> 01:18:41,570
And they did this to you?

878
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:44,038
Not exactly, no.

879
01:18:44,544 --> 01:18:48,446
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.

880
01:19:02,428 --> 01:19:04,555
It's changing out there.

881
01:19:04,997 --> 01:19:06,556
Just like last time.

882
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,662
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:19:10,403 --> 01:19:13,463
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:19:50,477 --> 01:19:53,504
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...

885
01:19:53,681 --> 01:19:56,514
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.

886
01:19:56,684 --> 01:20:00,346
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.

887
01:20:00,521 --> 01:20:02,615
We strongly suspect...

888
01:20:03,457 --> 01:20:05,449
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:20:05,627 --> 01:20:09,824
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:20:09,997 --> 01:20:14,230
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:20,039
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:20:30,351 --> 01:20:32,648
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.

893
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,984
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.

894
01:20:36,157 --> 01:20:37,283
Harry.

895
01:20:40,994 --> 01:20:42,986
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:20:43,598 --> 01:20:47,762
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

897
01:20:47,936 --> 01:20:53,841
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.

898
01:21:00,782 --> 01:21:02,374
Neville?

899
01:21:14,963 --> 01:21:17,090
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:21:17,265 --> 01:21:21,532
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:21:21,704 --> 01:21:24,900
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:21:25,473 --> 01:21:29,433
She tortured them for information...

903
01:21:29,612 --> 01:21:31,772
...but they never gave in.

904
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:35,940
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:21:36,918 --> 01:21:40,787
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:50,859
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.

907
01:21:55,104 --> 01:21:58,801
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:02,410
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:22:02,578 --> 01:22:03,977
George, your turn now.

910
01:22:05,347 --> 01:22:07,645
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:22:08,584 --> 01:22:12,020
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...

912
01:22:12,187 --> 01:22:16,021
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:17,420
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:22:18,127 --> 01:22:19,685
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:22:19,862 --> 01:22:23,889
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:26,365
So focus, Luna.

917
01:22:30,072 --> 01:22:31,768
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:22:31,942 --> 01:22:33,909
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:22:34,076 --> 01:22:36,943
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

920
01:22:37,113 --> 01:22:41,378
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.

921
01:22:42,117 --> 01:22:44,517
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:23:26,363 --> 01:23:28,888
I'll make short work of this.

923
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:32,224
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:23:50,521 --> 01:23:51,885
Get them.

925
01:23:52,322 --> 01:23:53,790
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,891
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:23:56,327 --> 01:24:00,024
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:24:01,398 --> 01:24:03,457
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:05,158
...never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:24:05,336 --> 01:24:07,395
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:11,405
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:24:11,575 --> 01:24:12,563
Naturally.

933
01:24:12,742 --> 01:24:15,267
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.

934
01:24:15,445 --> 01:24:19,109
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...

935
01:24:19,283 --> 01:24:24,117
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:24:24,287 --> 01:24:26,915
I instructed Harry to form this organization.

937
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:30,549
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.

938
01:24:30,728 --> 01:24:32,558
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:35,255
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

940
01:24:35,432 --> 01:24:40,234
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:24:40,404 --> 01:24:41,837
...to Azkaban...

942
01:24:43,074 --> 01:24:48,239
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:24:48,412 --> 01:24:51,347
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:24:52,516 --> 01:24:55,952
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...

945
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,953
What was the phrase?

946
01:24:58,122 --> 01:24:59,714
...come quietly.

947
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:01,586
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:04,325
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

949
01:25:04,496 --> 01:25:05,757
Enough of this.

950
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:07,356
Take him.

951
01:25:20,211 --> 01:25:24,581
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,877
...but you can't deny...

953
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:30,149
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:25:54,246 --> 01:25:58,876
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:02,486
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

956
01:26:02,654 --> 01:26:07,682
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

957
01:26:07,859 --> 01:26:12,159
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

958
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:24,962
Harry.

959
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:35,312
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.

960
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:37,847
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.

961
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:40,912
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

962
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:43,180
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:27:43,356 --> 01:27:45,325
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:50,022
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.

965
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,499
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

966
01:27:55,568 --> 01:27:59,767
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,602
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:28:02,776 --> 01:28:05,939
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

969
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:10,115
To go it alone.

970
01:28:16,456 --> 01:28:18,116
Hagrid.

971
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:24,296
Any idea where he's taking us?

972
01:28:24,464 --> 01:28:27,524
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

973
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:38,505
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:41,240
And they're dangerous at the best of times.

975
01:28:42,182 --> 01:28:44,514
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:28:44,685 --> 01:28:46,881
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.

977
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:48,715
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:51,119
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:56,251
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:28:56,897 --> 01:29:00,060
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.

981
01:29:00,233 --> 01:29:03,726
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:09,569
Grawpy.

983
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,072
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,116
Grawpy.

985
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:24,585
Brought you some company.

986
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:39,202
I couldn't just leave him, because...

987
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,103
Because he's my brother.

988
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:42,401
Blimey.

989
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,602
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:50,046
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,519
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,089
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?

993
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,522
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:00,991
Grawpy.

995
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:06,493
Grawp.

996
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,597
Put me down.

997
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:16,834
Now.

998
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:30,082
You all right?

999
01:30:31,393 --> 01:30:33,053
Fine.

1000
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:35,760
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,331
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:42,997
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,865
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:20,199
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.

1005
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:23,773
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:26,975
I'm the only family he's got.

1007
01:31:40,562 --> 01:31:42,428
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:31:45,702 --> 01:31:49,535
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1009
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:53,331
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:31:55,777 --> 01:31:58,941
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:31:59,115 --> 01:32:03,245
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,683
You're just like your father.

1013
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,653
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:32:08,825 --> 01:32:11,055
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:32:11,227 --> 01:32:13,388
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,964
Control your emotions.

1017
01:32:16,132 --> 01:32:19,067
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:32:21,905 --> 01:32:23,099
Legilimens.

1019
01:32:30,313 --> 01:32:31,405
Harry.

1020
01:32:31,581 --> 01:32:33,310
Sirius.

1021
01:32:33,983 --> 01:32:35,315
I may vomit.

1022
01:32:35,619 --> 01:32:36,642
Stop it.

1023
01:32:37,787 --> 01:32:40,085
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:43,650
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.

1025
01:32:43,827 --> 01:32:47,228
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:32:48,865 --> 01:32:50,765
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:32:50,934 --> 01:32:54,893
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:32:55,072 --> 01:32:58,439
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.

1029
01:32:58,609 --> 01:33:02,567
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:33:02,745 --> 01:33:05,771
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1031
01:33:06,817 --> 01:33:08,306
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1032
01:33:13,891 --> 01:33:15,415
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:33:15,593 --> 01:33:17,652
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:33:17,828 --> 01:33:19,659
Nice one, James.

1035
01:33:20,029 --> 01:33:22,328
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1036
01:33:22,499 --> 01:33:24,490
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:27,330
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1038
01:33:27,504 --> 01:33:29,768
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,134
Enough.

1040
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:34,702
Enough.

1041
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:45,814
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:33:45,991 --> 01:33:47,116
I...

1043
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:50,556
Get out.

1044
01:34:07,778 --> 01:34:09,939
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:34:10,114 --> 01:34:12,015
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:34:12,183 --> 01:34:15,209
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:34:15,387 --> 01:34:17,412
It's fading already.

1048
01:34:17,589 --> 01:34:22,321
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:34:29,701 --> 01:34:32,431
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:34:32,604 --> 01:34:36,369
...naughty children deserve to be punished.

1051
01:34:39,443 --> 01:34:40,775
You know, George...

1052
01:34:40,945 --> 01:34:44,608
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:34:44,783 --> 01:34:49,345
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:36:01,292 --> 01:36:02,954
All right, professor!

1055
01:36:11,737 --> 01:36:13,500
Here you go.

1056
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,295
Ready when you are.

1057
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:09,318
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:11,287
You'll have to kill me.

1059
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:16,720
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:38:16,898 --> 01:38:18,593
Crucio.

1061
01:38:21,135 --> 01:38:22,898
Crucio.

1062
01:38:34,282 --> 01:38:35,749
Sirius.

1063
01:38:35,917 --> 01:38:36,906
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:39,552
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,585
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1066
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:43,815
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:45,925
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.

1068
01:38:46,093 --> 01:38:49,392
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:51,498
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,991
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?

1071
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:59,433
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1072
01:38:59,608 --> 01:39:03,099
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

1073
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:06,769
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.

1074
01:39:09,383 --> 01:39:10,373
What do we do?

1075
01:39:11,786 --> 01:39:13,414
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:39:13,589 --> 01:39:15,647
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.

1077
01:39:15,823 --> 01:39:17,381
Not all of them.

1078
01:39:20,195 --> 01:39:21,525
Alohomora.

1079
01:39:32,773 --> 01:39:34,469
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:39:34,643 --> 01:39:38,203
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1081
01:39:38,379 --> 01:39:42,009
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:39:42,184 --> 01:39:45,415
That you are.

1083
01:39:45,587 --> 01:39:48,454
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:39:53,462 --> 01:39:55,555
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?

1085
01:39:55,731 --> 01:39:57,756
- No.
- Liar.

1086
01:39:57,933 --> 01:40:00,766
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:40:00,936 --> 01:40:04,394
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,364
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:09,442
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:40:09,611 --> 01:40:12,740
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:40:16,818 --> 01:40:18,286
Unless you wish to poison him...

1092
01:40:18,454 --> 01:40:22,890
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:40:23,492 --> 01:40:25,426
...I cannot help you.

1094
01:40:27,863 --> 01:40:29,559
He's got Padfoot.

1095
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,091
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.

1096
01:40:34,569 --> 01:40:36,696
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:40:36,872 --> 01:40:38,397
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,072
No idea.

1099
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:53,145
Very well.

1100
01:40:54,156 --> 01:40:56,489
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:40:56,859 --> 01:40:59,828
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:40:59,995 --> 01:41:02,055
...you leave me with...

1103
01:41:02,799 --> 01:41:04,767
...no alternative.

1104
01:41:05,568 --> 01:41:07,763
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:41:07,937 --> 01:41:08,926
That's illegal.

1106
01:41:09,105 --> 01:41:12,472
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.

1107
01:41:19,982 --> 01:41:21,506
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,452
Tell me what?

1109
01:41:25,655 --> 01:41:27,646
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:41:28,324 --> 01:41:30,087
...I will.

1111
01:41:31,729 --> 01:41:33,525
Where what is?

1112
01:41:34,732 --> 01:41:37,029
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:41:42,038 --> 01:41:43,563
How much further?

1114
01:41:43,741 --> 01:41:45,401
Not far.

1115
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:51,107
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:41:55,452 --> 01:41:56,919
What are you doing?

1117
01:41:57,087 --> 01:41:58,883
Improvising.

1118
01:42:07,396 --> 01:42:08,989
Well?

1119
01:42:10,299 --> 01:42:12,427
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:42:17,341 --> 01:42:19,605
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:42:22,379 --> 01:42:24,540
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:42:28,752 --> 01:42:30,310
You know...

1123
01:42:31,722 --> 01:42:33,747
...I really hate children.

1124
01:42:49,339 --> 01:42:53,777
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:42:56,447 --> 01:42:58,107
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:42:58,282 --> 01:43:03,811
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1127
01:43:03,987 --> 01:43:05,216
Protego.

1128
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:06,615
How dare you?

1129
01:43:07,257 --> 01:43:08,782
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,550
Incarcerous.

1131
01:43:23,774 --> 01:43:26,369
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:43:26,543 --> 01:43:31,208
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:43:40,058 --> 01:43:42,618
You filthy animal.

1134
01:43:42,794 --> 01:43:45,763
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:48,763
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:43:48,933 --> 01:43:50,798
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:43:58,477 --> 01:44:01,934
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:44:02,113 --> 01:44:04,048
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:44:04,216 --> 01:44:06,012
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:44:06,184 --> 01:44:07,174
What are you doing?

1141
01:44:07,353 --> 01:44:11,186
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:44:11,656 --> 01:44:13,851
Let me go!

1143
01:44:16,527 --> 01:44:18,325
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:44:18,497 --> 01:44:21,989
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:44:30,273 --> 01:44:33,834
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:44:34,009 --> 01:44:36,137
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.

1147
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,872
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:44:39,715 --> 01:44:41,206
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:44,542
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1150
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:46,518
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:51,417
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:44:52,261 --> 01:44:54,957
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:44:55,131 --> 01:44:58,100
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.

1154
01:44:58,434 --> 01:45:00,561
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:45:02,438 --> 01:45:05,635
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:45:10,546 --> 01:45:12,707
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:45:14,117 --> 01:45:16,347
We fly, of course.

1158
01:46:07,404 --> 01:46:09,565
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:46:18,415 --> 01:46:20,110
This is it.

1160
01:47:13,104 --> 01:47:15,435
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.

1161
01:47:17,141 --> 01:47:18,505
Ninety-four.

1162
01:47:19,777 --> 01:47:20,801
Ninety-five.

1163
01:47:33,358 --> 01:47:36,122
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:40,127
It's got your name on it.

1165
01:48:05,323 --> 01:48:09,693
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:48:10,529 --> 01:48:12,963
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...

1167
01:48:13,132 --> 01:48:15,930
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1168
01:48:21,573 --> 01:48:26,943
For neither can live while the other survives.

1169
01:48:29,448 --> 01:48:30,540
Harry.

1170
01:48:41,026 --> 01:48:42,516
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:48:42,695 --> 01:48:47,792
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:48:50,703 --> 01:48:52,864
...and reality.

1173
01:48:54,139 --> 01:48:59,076
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

1174
01:48:59,778 --> 01:49:01,268
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:49:01,447 --> 01:49:03,540
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1176
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:08,879
He knows how to play.

1177
01:49:09,055 --> 01:49:12,854
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:49:13,025 --> 01:49:14,254
Potter.

1179
01:49:14,794 --> 01:49:16,693
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:49:16,862 --> 01:49:19,797
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:49:19,966 --> 01:49:21,830
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1182
01:49:24,670 --> 01:49:29,472
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:49:29,942 --> 01:49:31,433
...shall we?

1184
01:49:31,611 --> 01:49:34,079
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:49:34,247 --> 01:49:36,441
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?

1186
01:49:36,615 --> 01:49:38,243
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:49:39,786 --> 01:49:41,378
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:49:41,553 --> 01:49:44,148
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:49:46,092 --> 01:49:51,553
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:49:51,731 --> 01:49:54,461
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:00,172
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:50:00,673 --> 01:50:05,872
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:50:06,613 --> 01:50:09,104
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:50:09,282 --> 01:50:11,807
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:50:13,186 --> 01:50:17,987
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:50:18,925 --> 01:50:23,328
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

1197
01:50:24,531 --> 01:50:26,522
All you have to do...

1198
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,034
...is give it to me.

1199
01:50:29,335 --> 01:50:32,634
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:50:41,381 --> 01:50:43,178
I've waited 14 years.

1201
01:50:43,783 --> 01:50:45,081
I know.

1202
01:50:46,386 --> 01:50:49,321
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.

1203
01:50:49,489 --> 01:50:50,923
Stupefy.

1204
01:51:07,073 --> 01:51:08,063
Levicorpus.

1205
01:51:14,615 --> 01:51:16,640
Petrificus Totalus.

1206
01:51:16,817 --> 01:51:18,614
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:51:27,061 --> 01:51:28,619
Stupefy.

1208
01:51:30,364 --> 01:51:31,592
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1209
01:51:42,743 --> 01:51:44,643
Stupefy.

1210
01:51:52,186 --> 01:51:54,484
Reducto.

1211
01:52:10,505 --> 01:52:12,598
Get back to the door.

1212
01:52:47,909 --> 01:52:52,403
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?

1213
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:59,519
The voices.

1214
01:53:00,089 --> 01:53:02,113
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:53:03,792 --> 01:53:05,954
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:53:06,695 --> 01:53:08,459
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:10,222
I hear them too.

1218
01:53:13,335 --> 01:53:15,963
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1219
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,140
Please, Harry.

1220
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:22,775
Get behind me.

1221
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:12,021
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:54:12,194 --> 01:54:16,791
...or were you truly naive enough to think...

1223
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:22,532
...that children stood a chance against us?

1224
01:54:26,042 --> 01:54:29,773
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:54:33,483 --> 01:54:36,816
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:54:36,987 --> 01:54:40,979
...or watch your friends die.

1227
01:54:53,904 --> 01:54:55,302
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:55:21,598 --> 01:55:24,363
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:55:54,464 --> 01:55:57,058
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.

1230
01:55:57,401 --> 01:55:59,233
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:55:59,404 --> 01:56:02,237
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,535
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:05,697
Black.

1234
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:34,201
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:56:34,372 --> 01:56:35,703
Nice one, James.

1236
01:56:42,948 --> 01:56:44,414
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:57:04,635 --> 01:57:06,934
No. No.

1238
01:57:30,896 --> 01:57:33,557
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:57:34,533 --> 01:57:36,500
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1240
01:57:48,847 --> 01:57:51,975
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1241
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:55,916
She killed him. She deserves it.

1242
01:57:59,758 --> 01:58:02,955
You know the spell, Harry.

1243
01:58:14,506 --> 01:58:16,134
Do it.

1244
01:58:23,815 --> 01:58:26,784
So weak.

1245
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:36,757
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.

1246
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:38,659
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:58:38,831 --> 01:58:43,029
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:58:44,571 --> 01:58:46,663
...shall be dead.

1249
02:01:00,975 --> 02:01:02,875
You've lost, old man.

1250
02:01:23,031 --> 02:01:24,020
Harry.

1251
02:01:28,169 --> 02:01:29,659
So weak.

1252
02:01:30,171 --> 02:01:32,401
So vulnerable.

1253
02:01:36,711 --> 02:01:37,700
Look at me.

1254
02:01:40,248 --> 02:01:44,480
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1255
02:01:44,652 --> 02:01:47,143
It's how you are not.

1256
02:01:52,093 --> 02:01:53,584
Harry?

1257
02:02:25,995 --> 02:02:27,462
You're the weak one...

1258
02:02:28,063 --> 02:02:32,193
...and you'll never know love or friendship.

1259
02:02:35,603 --> 02:02:38,505
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
02:03:01,564 --> 02:03:05,022
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
02:03:05,968 --> 02:03:11,099
And you will lose everything.

1262
02:03:26,055 --> 02:03:27,717
He's back.

1263
02:04:35,458 --> 02:04:37,120
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
02:04:37,295 --> 02:04:38,886
No, you don't.

1265
02:04:44,534 --> 02:04:45,934
It's my fault.

1266
02:04:46,103 --> 02:04:49,368
No, the fault is mine.

1267
02:04:50,373 --> 02:04:52,137
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:55,370
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

1269
02:04:56,179 --> 02:05:00,446
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

1270
02:05:00,618 --> 02:05:05,851
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.

1271
02:05:08,659 --> 02:05:11,992
The prophecy said:

1272
02:05:12,596 --> 02:05:16,555
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."

1273
02:05:17,902 --> 02:05:23,966
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:05:25,977 --> 02:05:27,535
Yes.

1275
02:05:28,013 --> 02:05:29,570
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:05:29,747 --> 02:05:33,342
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:05:33,518 --> 02:05:35,951
The same reason your friends saved you.

1278
02:05:36,788 --> 02:05:40,314
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:43,392
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.

1280
02:05:44,863 --> 02:05:46,989
I cared too much about you.

1281
02:06:11,857 --> 02:06:14,155
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:06:14,326 --> 02:06:18,888
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1283
02:06:19,064 --> 02:06:20,053
That's awful.

1284
02:06:20,232 --> 02:06:22,132
Oh, it's all good fun.

1285
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:25,758
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1286
02:06:25,937 --> 02:06:28,303
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:06:31,209 --> 02:06:34,406
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:06:41,453 --> 02:06:43,512
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

1289
02:06:43,688 --> 02:06:45,349
That's all right.

1290
02:06:45,524 --> 02:06:47,685
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:06:47,859 --> 02:06:51,727
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:06:54,966 --> 02:06:58,232
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:06:59,738 --> 02:07:02,434
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:07:38,111 --> 02:07:41,012
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:42,874
What's that?

1296
02:07:43,483 --> 02:07:46,247
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:07:46,419 --> 02:07:49,513
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1298
02:07:49,689 --> 02:07:51,179
Yeah?

1299
02:07:53,092 --> 02:07:55,458
Something worth fighting for.
